# Stop hook: catch the "Telegram inbound this turn, no reply tool call" slip
# and either auto-relay the assistant's transcript text, block the Stop so
# the agent retries, or curl a diagnostic — depending on what's in the
# transcript.
#
# Why: claude agents paired over Telegram sometimes "talk to the transcript"
# instead of calling mcp__plugin_telegram_telegram__reply. The MCP guidance
# is loaded every turn but easy to skim — especially for short answers that
# feel like chat. Prompt-level reminders haven't been enough; this hook is
# the safety net.
#
# Decision tree (slip = had_inbound && !had_tool):
#   slip + last_text non-empty       → curl "(auto-relay) <text>"
#   slip + empty text, first time    → JSON {decision:"block"} (agent retries)
#   slip + empty text, re-entry      → curl enriched diagnostic
#
# Loop safety (three layers — any one is sufficient):
#   1. payload.stop_hook_active=true set by the harness on Stop re-invocation
#      after a block. We never emit another block in that path.
#   2. /tmp/5dive-stopblock-<sha1(transcript_path)>.lock written when we
#      block, removed when re-entry runs. Belt-and-suspenders if the
#      harness flag is ever absent — once the lock exists, the empty-text
#      branch falls through to the diagnostic instead of blocking again.
#   3. Block decision is only emitted on the empty-text branch, so a model
#      producing any text will hit auto-relay and never loop.
# Worst case: 2 hook invocations per Stop event, both bounded by timeout: 10.
#
# Wired in $HOME/.claude/settings.json by inc/5dive-cli.sh's
# preseed_claude_agent only when channels=telegram. Token comes from
# TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, exported into the agent's systemd env from
# /etc/5dive/connectors/telegram-<name>.env.

# Normal path: analyze current turn. A turn starts at the most-recent entry
# where type=user AND .message.content is a STRING — that pattern is the
# initial real user/channel prompt (tool_result feedback also has type=user
# but content is an array, so it's excluded). Within the turn:
#   - had_telegram_inbound: any user content (initial OR system-reminder
#     embedded in a tool_result) contains a telegram <channel> block. The
#     channel plugin injects "A message arrived while you were working"
#     system-reminders into tool_results, so mid-turn inbounds count.
#   - had_telegram_tool_call: any assistant tool_use called one of the
#     mcp__plugin_telegram_telegram__{reply,react,edit_message} tools. Any
#     of those satisfies the "something reached Telegram" rule — a pure
#     reaction-only turn (e.g. acking a status ping) is intentional.
#   - texts: every non-empty assistant text block in the turn, in order.
#     We auto-relay every block past relayed_count from the state file;
#     joining all-unrelayed beats picking just the last one, which used
#     to miss text emitted before mid-turn tool calls.
#   - last_chat_id / last_message_id: chat_id and message_id from the
#     most-recent inbound — chat is who we relay to; message_id goes into
#     the block reason / diagnostic so the operator can identify which
#     message went unanswered.
