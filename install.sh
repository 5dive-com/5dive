#  THIS FILE DEPLOYS ON MERGE. THERE IS NO TAG BETWEEN YOU AND THE FLEET.
# ============================================================================
# Everywhere else in this repo, merging is STAGING and the release cut is the
# publish act. Not here. This file is fetched from `refs/heads/main` and run AS
# ROOT on every box's next `--upgrade` (`src/cmd_selfupdate.sh`, `5dive uninstall`,
# and the public `curl … | sudo bash`). A merge to it is live fleet-wide within
# one upgrade cycle, with no tag, no cut, and no rollback point.
#
# So the rule everyone was taught — "merging is safe, the cut is the risky part" —
# is EXACTLY BACKWARDS in this file, and nothing in a diff or a PR title says so.
# That inversion is DIVE-2288; this comment is the fix for it.
#
# The same property holds for the six BRANCH-TARBALL fetches below (skills and
# 5dive-plugins, marked `MERGE-DEPLOYS` at each site) — those land root-installed
# from ANOTHER repo's mutable main, where no control in this repo can see them.
#
# THE COUNT, WITH ITS SCOPE AND ITS DATE, because a bare figure at an edit site is
# the very thing this comment exists to prevent:
#   7 live sites ON THE ROOT-INSTALLED-ON-UPGRADE RAIL — this file plus the six
#   branch tarballs below — as of 2026-07-30, measured against 6f5e5c9.
#   DIVE-2308 enumerated 9 on 2026-07-29 against 44e612f. Row 8 (the version probe
#   calling main HEAD "published") is CLOSED: `_published_cli_probe` now resolves
#   the newest release tag and fails closed. Row 9 (the `status` badge branch) is
#   public-by-design and off the install path.
#   ADJACENT AND DELIBERATELY NOT IN THE 7 — a different rail, named so the number
#   cannot be mistaken for the whole population: `_marketplace_base`
#   (src/cmd_pack.sh) and `_loops_base` (src/cmd_loop_pack.sh) each fetch another
#   repo's mutable main, but ON DEMAND when a user runs the verb, not root-installed
#   on every upgrade.
# Full enumeration and its negative space (DIVE-2308, corrected 2026-07-30):
#   community/wiki/the-merge-deploys-population-is-scoped-to-the-box-not-to-the-repo.md
#
# Everything else the installer places comes through `$REPO`, which DIVE-2144
# pins to the newest release TAG. If you are adding a fetch, decide which of the
# two you are in and say so at the site.

# >>> DIVE-1977 pin-resolution block (extracted verbatim by tests/install_pin_sha_unit.sh)
# DIVE-1977: every path under raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/5dive/main is an
# INDEPENDENT CDN object with its own cache generation, so for a window after
# each release the CDN can hand back the PREVIOUS bundle next to the NEW
# 5dive.sha256. Nothing is corrupt and nothing was tampered with — the two
# objects simply do not describe each other — but the checksum guard in
# refresh_managed_files() fails closed and blames "corrupt download or tampered
# mirror", which is a security-shaped alarm raised by a cache race on an
# unattended 04:00 self-update.
#
# So resolve the mutable `main` ref to ONE immutable commit sha here, once, and
# fetch every asset from raw/<sha>/. Staleness is fine: if the resolver hands
# back a slightly older sha, both objects come from that one tree and the box
# installs the previous release for a few minutes — a non-event. INCONSISTENCY
# is the thing that is unfixable at the client, and a pinned tree cannot be
# inconsistent. The guard itself stays exactly as strict as it was.
#
# DIVE-2144: WHAT we resolve changed, and it is the whole point of that ticket.
# It used to be the tip of `main`, which made merging identical to publishing:
# an unreviewed merge was live on every box within one self-update, and the
# version-assign commit sat on the customer critical path (DIVE-2118/2141/2142).
# Now it is the newest RELEASE TAG. Cutting a tag becomes the publish act;
# merging only stages. The pin mechanism below is unchanged — same ladder, same
# raw/<sha>/ fetch, same DIVE-1977 consistency property — only its INPUT moved.
#
# Two ways to get this wrong, both measured on the real 285-tag repo, both of
# which succeed loudly-plausibly rather than failing:
#
#   LEXICAL SORT. `sort | tail -1` — the form almost everyone writes — returns
#   v0.9.9, not v0.15.34. That ships a six-minor-version DOWNGRADE to every box
#   while exiting 0 with a real tag name in the log. Nothing downstream catches
#   it: the sha is valid, the tree is consistent, the pin is honest. Version-sort
#   (`sort -V`) is load-bearing, not tidiness. tests/install_pin_sha_unit.sh
#   proves it by mutation.
#
#   FAILING OPEN TO /main. The old block fell back to the mutable ref when
#   nothing resolved. Keeping that here would invert its meaning: pre-2144 the
#   fallback was a PIN failure (same content, unpinned, risk = inconsistency);
#   post-2144 the identical line is a POLICY failure (DIFFERENT, ungated content
#   shipped as root). And "no tag resolves" is not a random event — it correlates
#   with tags deleted, release process broken, incident in progress. So we fail
#   CLOSED, which is a no-op, not a brick: the box keeps the CLI it already has,
#   exactly as it does every hour nothing is published. Two explicit valves out
#   already exist and the error names both — GH_SHA (pin a tree directly) and
#   REPO (override the source entirely).

# >>> DIVE-2243 monotonicity guard (extracted verbatim by tests/install_monotonicity_unit.sh)
# DIVE-2243: the DIVE-2144 cutover moved publishing from mutable `main` HEAD to
# the newest release TAG. For ~23h the newest tag (v0.16.32) sat BELOW what the
# fleet was running (0.16.33, .34, .36, then 0.17.0) because release-cut.yml had
# never once succeeded (DIVE-2238). Every box that self-updated inside that
# window rolled BACKWARDS — and printed `5dive upgraded: 0.16.33 -> 0.16.32`
# while doing it.
#
# Nothing here noticed, because nothing here could: the only version comparison
# on the upgrade path was `!=`, and its only job was choosing which of two report
# strings to print. `sort -V` appears above to pick the newest TAG, and never
# once to compare that tag's payload against what is already installed. So the
# old version's sole purpose was a printed string, and that string asserted the
# one thing the code never checked.
#
# A cutover that STALLS is loud — nothing updates, someone notices staleness. A
# cutover that REVERSES presents as success: an update ran, it exited 0, and it
# said "upgraded". Every signal a monitor watches says the system worked. It was
# caught only because a human happened to read the same version number twice.
#
# So make DIRECTION a first-class assertion, separate from the action:
#
#   - Refuse a strictly-lower candidate by default, naming both versions and the
#     tag/sha it came from. Same fail-closed posture the tag resolver above takes
#     for "no tag resolves", and equally a no-op rather than a brick: the box
#     keeps the CLI it already has, exactly as it does every hour nothing is
#     published.
#   - A real rollback is a legitimate operation, so it stays possible — but it
#     must be ASKED FOR (FIVE_ALLOW_DOWNGRADE=1), never a side effect of tag
#     resolution.
#   - Refuse only on versions we can actually ORDER. An unreadable installed or
#     candidate version is not evidence of a backwards move, and bricking an
#     upgrade over a grep that came back empty would be a worse failure than the
#     one this guards. Those cases WARN, name which side was unreadable, and
#     proceed.

# version_lt A B — true when semver A sorts strictly below B. Equal → false.

# >>> DIVE-3554 buzz binary staging (extracted verbatim by tests/install_buzz_binaries_unit.sh)
# The Connect Buzz panel (DIVE-3551) runs `5dive agent buzz pair`, which shells
# out to `buzz-pair`; joining a channel shells out to `buzz`. Until this block
# NOTHING on any box installed either one — the cli-v0.1.x releases on
# <org>/buzz attach them, but no install/provision/update path downloaded them,
# so the shipped panel dead-ended at the verb's "no buzz binary" refusal on every
# box except the one where a human hand-placed the asset. This is that path.
#
# WHY HERE. Enumerated the writers of /usr/local/bin/buzz before adding one:
# there were none. `git grep buzz` on 5dive-api's main is EMPTY (provisioning
# never mentions it) and this repo's only pre-existing hits were the *claude
# plugin* named "buzz" and the resolver in cmd_agent_buzz.sh that LOOKS for the
# binary. refresh_managed_files() is the one layer that already owns
# /usr/local/bin on a customer box and is reached by all three paths that must
# be covered: the default install (fresh provision), `--upgrade`, and the
# customer nightly (5dive-api/scripts/update.sh re-curls install.5dive.com,
# which lands right back here). Adding a second writer elsewhere would have made
# two.
#
# VERSION-PINNED TO A TAG, NOT "latest". A moving `latest` would hand every box
# a different binary on any night the buzz repo publishes, with no review and no
# way to say which build a box is running. Bump BUZZ_CLI_TAG and
# BUZZ_SUMS_SHA256 together, in one commit, as a deliberate act.
#
# TWO-LEVEL INTEGRITY, and the second level is the load-bearing one. The release
# ships SHA256SUMS next to the binaries, so verifying a binary against it catches
# a corrupt download or a mangling mirror. It does NOT catch a swapped release
# asset: a GitHub release asset is MUTABLE even on an immutable tag — someone
# with write access can delete `buzz` and upload different bytes under the same
# tag, and re-upload a matching SHA256SUMS with it, and every box would verify
# green against the attacker's own manifest. So the manifest itself is pinned to
# a constant in this file, which a release-side swap cannot reach. Verifying
# against a manifest you downloaded from the same place as the payload is not a
# check; it is a spell.

  # Pre-push PII guard (DIVE-1797 enforcement, DIVE-2788 portable mode,
  # DIVE-2803 provisioning reach). TWO SEPARATE ARTIFACTS, in this order:
  #
  #   1. the GUARD HOME (/usr/local/share/5dive/pii-guard) — the ONE host copy
  #      of the portable hook + scanner + denylist that every portable install
  #      reads. It is staged below from $REPO.
  #   2. the box's own 5dive-ai/5dive CHECKOUT, if it has one, pointed at its
  #      IN-REPO hooks (a relative core.hooksPath) — the loop further down.
  #
  # WHY 1 IS STAGED FROM $REPO AND NOT FROM A CHECKOUT. Until DIVE-2803 the only
  # writer of the guard home was `install-pii-push-guard.sh` running out of a
  # checkout of this repo, and a freshly provisioned box HAS NO SUCH CHECKOUT:
  # install.sh installs a released bundle and stages skills from tarballs, and
  # `git clone` appears nowhere in this file. So the loop below iterated zero
  # times and the guard home was never created — the whole PII block was a no-op
  # on precisely the boxes provisioning creates, which is the "fleet-wide decays
  # from the day it is written" defect this row exists to close.
  #
  # WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT DONE HERE: `scripts/pii-guard-fleet.sh --install`
  # is NOT called from this path (DIVE-2803 gate, answered B on 2026-08-06).
  # That tool's blast radius is bounded by an EPERM-by-owner branch that leaves
  # a checkout it cannot write alone and REPORTS it. install.sh runs as ROOT,
  # where that branch can never fire: root writes every uid's .git/config
  # successfully, so nothing is left to report and nothing stops it. Wiring it
  # here would reach every agent uid's checkout on every box and every update —
  # strictly wider than the claude-owned radius it was reviewed against. It
  # stays available, and stays report-only.
  #
  # Best-effort + idempotent throughout: safe to re-run, and it runs on the
  # daily update too, because this whole function is the --upgrade path. That
  # matters on its own — the guard home is the single update point for the
  # denylist, so a box that installs once and never re-syncs grades against a
  # frozen list, which is the drift the host-path design exists to avoid.
  #
  # >>> DIVE-2803 guard-home staging (extracted verbatim by tests/pii_guard_fleet_unit.sh)
  # Mirror the repo's own layout under $LIB_DIR so install-pii-push-guard.sh
  # resolves its three sources from $SELF_DIR/.. unchanged — no second copy of
  # the "which files make a guard home" list, which would be a second thing to
  # keep in step. PII_GUARD_SRC_SHA carries the provenance a staged tree cannot
  # read from a .git it does not have; empty is honest and stamps UNKNOWN.
