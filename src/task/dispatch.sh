# -------- 5dive task — dispatch --------
#
# Split out of src/cmd_task.sh (DIVE-3278): the ENTRY POINT: `task` usage text, the subcommand dispatcher, the worktree
# reclaim-on-close hook, and the set-* mutators (branch, body, title, overlap,
# budget, wip-cap) plus `task init`.
#
# Concatenated into the single-file bundle by build.sh, and sourced by
# src/cmd_task.sh when the split tree is used (tests source src/cmd_task.sh).
# Function definitions only — never execute this file directly.

# `npm ci`-regenerable output — no commit or branch can live there, so removing
# it is structurally data-loss-free. The worktree DIRECTORY may hold unpushed

# `task add` it was immutable except by a direct sqlite UPDATE, which scoped-sudo
# makers cannot do. That asymmetry is the wrong way round. A body correction lands
# where a careful reader will find it; a WRONG TITLE is what the next reader sees
# FIRST, on the board, in the digest, in every gate alert — and this ticket's own
# sibling DIVE-2846 shipped with an overstated claim in its title that only a body
# appendix retracts. Overwrite-only (there is no coherent "append" to a title), and
# audited with the PRIOR title, because a retitle is exactly the edit that makes the
# earlier discussion of a row unreadable if nobody can see what it used to say.
# Refuses on a closed task, same guard as set-body: a closed row is frozen.
# DIVE-2794 — set/raise/exempt a row's token budget AFTER it was filed.
#
# This verb is the difference between a usable carve-out and a theoretical one.
# The enforced 5M default parks a row the heartbeat finds over budget, and the
# incident case main flagged is a LIVE row at 3am that nobody filed with
# `--task-budget=none` because nobody was thinking about budgets when the box
# went down. Without a post-hoc setter the only escape is re-filing the row,
# which loses its history mid-incident — so the exemption would exist only for
# people who predicted they would need it. Unparking alone is NOT enough and is
# the trap this closes: the sweep re-parks the row on the very next tick unless
# the budget itself changed.
# DIVE-2794 arm two — install the per-lane WIP caps. Deliberate, once, and the
# ONLY thing that creates a cap: no cap is ever minted as a side effect of a
# filing. Snapshots each lane's current actionable count as its frozen ceiling.
#
# Idempotent by default: a lane that already has a cap keeps it, because
# re-snapshotting is exactly the "cap tracks the count" lock this arm exists to
# avoid — running install twice must not ratchet anybody. --relane <lane> resets
# one lane deliberately (a lead clear, the one sanctioned way a cap moves).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `5dive task set-parent <id|DIVE-N> <DIVE-N|id|none>` — DIVE-3275.
#
# `parent_id` was INSERT-only: `task add --parent=<id>` was the sole moment a
# parent edge could ever be written, so a row split out of another one and filed
# without `--parent` could never be attached afterwards. The relationship then
# survives only as prose in a body, and `task show <parent>` renders no edge to
# it. That already cost a real verification: DIVE-3138 was split out of DIVE-2895
# in words but filed unparented, so the maker closing DIVE-2895 asserted an item
# was blocked on work DIVE-3138 had finished 2h36m earlier. The fix list said
# "set parent_id on DIVE-3138" and there was no verb that could.
# (community/wiki/a-split-out-row-with-no-parent-link-is-invisible-to-the-row-it-came-from.md)
#
# A CLOSED ROW CAN BE RE-PARENTED — deliberately NOT set-title's refusal (spec
# decided by olivia, 2026-08-12). Closing freezes the record of what was
# ASSERTED — body and result, the text a later reader quotes back. `parent_id` is
# not an assertion by the closer; it is a navigation edge, and its ABSENCE is the
# entire defect: DIVE-3138 was already closed when its missing edge produced the
# false premise. A blanket closed-row refusal would ship a verb that cannot fix
# the case that motivated it. So: audited like set-title, and it does not reopen
# the row, touch `done_at`, or bump `updated_at` — the write is to the graph, and
# nothing about the closed record's own timeline changes.
