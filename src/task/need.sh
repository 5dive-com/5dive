# Split out of src/cmd_task.sh (DIVE-3278): `task need` — the human gate. Every predicate that decides whether a gate needs
# a human, which seat may clear it, and what tier it floors to; plus the filing
# verb itself and the precedent/routing read-only views.
#
# Concatenated into the single-file bundle by build.sh, and sourced by
# src/cmd_task.sh when the split tree is used (tests source src/cmd_task.sh).
# Function definitions only — never execute this file directly.
# --- Human Task Inbox (DIVE-103; parent feature DIVE-102) ----------------
# `need` parks a task on a human; `inbox` lists what's waiting; `answer`
# records the human's reply, unblocks, and pings the agent that hit the gate.

# OSS-21: precedent auto-clear policy switch. `5dive task precedent [on|off]`
# (bare / `status` reports state). When ON, a resolved tier-1 gate that matches
# proven human precedent clears itself at file-time (see cmd_task_need). Default
# is OFF fleet-wide until the OSS-16 policy owner (lodar) flips it. Read-only
# `status` needs no privilege; on/off is a policy write.

# DIVE-891/CNCL-14: the T2 category floor. The shipped defaults make money,
# public/customer comms, secrets, and destructive/irreversible actions a hard
# human gate; a valid company constitution replaces those classes as data.
# A matched class is ALWAYS a hard human gate, regardless of the tier the
# filing agent asked for — the floor is enforced here, not trusted from the
# filer. Matched case-insensitively over ask + title. The bias is deliberately
# toward false positives: a wrongly-ELEVATED gate costs the human one tap; a
# wrongly-lowered one would let a spend/publish call auto-apply. Bar-raise,
# same posture as gate-proof (a determined agent can still word around it —
# but only by loudly not-naming what it's asking for, which the ask text then
# fails to justify).
# DIVE-2241: the HUMAN-CLASS capability constants. A gate may DECLARE the
# capability its ask consumes with `--needs=<capability>`; exactly three names
# resolve to the paired human, and they resolve as CONSTANTS, not as a lookup.
#
# Why a constant and not the DIVE-2102 capability registry this was originally
# sequenced behind: that registry is a SUDOERS MIRROR — its vocabulary is five
# command grants and its holder key is `holder_agent`. lodar has no agent account
# and no sudoers entry, so these three are not "undeclared, pending declaration",
# they are INEXPRESSIBLE in that schema and always will be. A registry derived
# from a permission system answers "who may RUN this", never "who may DECIDE
# this". See community/wiki/an-oracle-that-mirrors-sudoers-answers-permission-\
# not-authority.md.
#
# Why a shipped shell constant is the DIVE-2099 anchor and a routing table is not:
# agents here hold NOPASSWD:ALL, so any table an agent can `sudo 5dive ... set` is
# an authority the beneficiary can grant itself — naming itself the holder of
# human_tap is one command. This list is a name sealed into the release artifact:
# changing it means changing the code that ships and passes review, and the
# installed binary's sha256 (5dive.sha256) no longer matches. There is deliberately
# NO write path — not root-guarded, ABSENT — because `require_root` answers "can
# this principal write here", which on this host is always yes (DIVE-2131).
#
#   human_tap        — a person's call: brand, strategy, an irreversible choice.
#   spend_authority  — billing / paid accounts. NOT smoke runs: lodar pre-approved
#                      those 2026-07-27, so a smoke gate declares nothing here.
#   secret_provision — a new token / credential must come FROM a human.
#
# Anything else — including a typo, and including a real agent capability like
# delegated_push — is UNRECOGNISED and falls through to today's routing untouched
# (see _gate_needs_human below). Absence means UNDECLARED, never non-holding.
_GATE_HUMAN_CAPABILITIES='human_tap spend_authority secret_provision'
# True iff $1 is one of the human-class constants. Whitespace-fenced substring
# match so no capability can hit by prefix (`human_tap_delegate` must NOT match).
#
# NORMALISE FIRST (Marcus, pre-merge read on #288). Exact matching makes a TYPO
# SILENTLY WEAKER: `--needs=human-tap` / `HUMAN_TAP` fell through to a tier-1,
# agent-clearable, TTL-auto-appliable gate while the filer believed they had just
# secured a human. The fall-through is loud — but the warn goes to whoever ran the
# command, and the common caller is an agent filing programmatically in a headless
# session: the reader least likely to see it and most likely to believe the
# declaration held.
#
# Why NORMALISE and not REFUSE-on-unknown, which was the other way to close it: an
# unknown name must keep falling through, because gh_push / root / delegated_push
# are deliberately unroutable here pending DIVE-2156, and hard-failing them would
# break a newer capability on an older CLI. Normalising kills the whole near-miss
# class (case + separator, the only two ways to write these names wrong) while
# leaving forward-compat intact. Deliberately NOT edit distance: a resolver that
# guesses what you meant is a new thing to be wrong about, and this one decides
# whether a human is required.

# DIVE-2629: THE FLOOR MUST READ THE ACTION, NOT THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE CODE.
#
# THE DEFECT, measured by main 2026-08-03 by running _gate_tier2_floor_hit on four
# ask strings that differ by ONE token:
#
#   'approve delegated push for review of branch dive-2613-teardown-outcomes-...'  -> T2
#   'approve delegated push for review of branch dive-2613-outcomes-hetzner-only'  -> T1
#   'approve delegated push for review of branch dive-XXXX-teardown-foo'           -> T2
#   'approve delegated push for review of branch dive-2592-budget-variance'        -> T1
#
# The word 'teardown' appearing ONLY inside a git branch NAME forces tier 2. The
# floor exists to catch DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS; the action here is "push a feature
# branch to a remote for review" — inert by construction, no merge, no prod touch,
# reversible. What is destructive-sounding is the SUBJECT of the code on the
# branch. The floor was reading what the work is ABOUT and grading it as what the
# gate DOES, so the better a branch name describes the work the likelier it floors:
# the naming convention we WANT is the one that trips it.
#
# WHY THAT IS A RATCHET AND NOT ONE EXTRA TAP. A tier-2 approval is filed with NO
# routed_reviewer, and cmd_task_answer's designated-reviewer exception requires
# actor == routed_reviewer. So NO agent can ever clear it — not the filer, not
# their lead, not the org coordinator — and no agent action hands it back. It is
# permanently the human's. DIVE-2613 is one of the six eng gates lodar objected to
# on 2026-08-03 ("can you stop pinging me for dev stuff") and dev2 stayed blocked
# behind it. The floor's usual "a false positive costs one tap" bias does not hold
# on this path, because there is no tap that gives it back.
#
# THE FIX SCOPES THE MATCH, NOT THE VERDICT (main's shape, adopted). Exempting the
# individual words would be the tempting non-fix — it keeps the wrong question and
# tidies the answer, the same way stripping +suffix was the non-fix on DIVE-2594.
# Instead: when — and only when — the text is recognised as an INERT
# push-for-review, the git branch IDENTIFIER is removed before the floor reads it.
# A branch name is a label, never a statement of the action a gate authorises.
# Everything else in the ask is still read, unchanged: a push ask that ALSO names a
# spend, a secret or a publish still floors, because those words are in the prose.
#
# THREE NARROWINGS, all deliberate, all biased toward KEEPING the floor:
#
#   1. NOT the whole eng-ship class. _gate_eng_ship_hit also covers merge, deploy,
#      roll-to-fleet and push-to-main — those TOUCH PROD and are not inert, so they
#      must keep flooring on their subject matter. _GATE_PUSH_NOT_INERT_RX kicks
#      the text back out of this exemption the moment it names one of them, which
#      is why "push branch X for review, then merge to main" is unchanged.
#   2. Only BRANCH-SHAPED tokens are redacted, not every hyphenated word. A slug
#      qualifies on a slash (feat/x), a ticket prefix (dive-2613-...), or two or
#      more hyphens (a-b-c). So 'auto-teardown' in prose survives and still floors:
#      one hyphen and no ticket prefix is a WORD, and when the shape is ambiguous
#      the floor stays on.
#   3. Applied HERE, at the single match site, so every consumer — cmd_task_need's
#      filing floor, the approval/manual routing arm, and cmd_goal's low-risk
#      check — inherits the same verdict from the same inputs, which is the
#      property _gate_floor_axis exists to preserve.
#
# NOT ATTEMPTED, and it is a separate ticket: DIVE-2592 routed to olivia when its
# filer dev reports_to main. That is _gate_route_reviewer, not the floor, and main
# explicitly did not diagnose it — do not fold it in here.
_GATE_PUSH_FOR_REVIEW_RX='delegated push|push[- ]for[- ]review|5dive push|push[^.]*(for review|for a pr|for code review|branch)'
# The DESTINATION clause is `\bto\b … (main|master|prod)`, NOT `push to (main|…)`.
# Found by the pre-land corpus sweep, and it is the one arm the fix got wrong on
# first writing: DIVE-1940's real ask is "Push branch dive-1940-token-ux @ 3d9851a0
# to 5dive-frontend MAIN". The adjacent form `push to main` cannot see a repo name
# sitting between the verb and its destination, so a push to a repo's default
# branch was inheriting the inert-push exemption. It floored before this change
# only by accident — on the word 'token' inside the branch name — so the sweep is
# what caught it, not the defect it was sweeping for. Bounded distance is safe here
# in a way DIVE-2224 forbids across a seam: this matches inside ONE field.
_GATE_PUSH_NOT_INERT_RX='\bmerg(e|es|ed|ing)\b|deploy|redeploy|\brelease\b|roll ?out|\broll(ing|ed)? out\b|roll[^.]*fleet|fleet[- ]?roll|\bto\b[^.]{0,60}\b(main|master|prod|production|trunk)\b|\bland (the|it|this)\b'

# DIVE-3307: _GATE_PUSH_NOT_INERT_RX above reads SUBJECT MATTER, not the requested
# ACTION. An ask that merely DESCRIBES a merge/deploy trips it and is graded as a
# request to perform one. Measured on DIVE-3302's live gate: "…toward the core-tier
# overage freezing all merges" un-suppressed the DIVE-3117 lead route on the word
# `merges` and sent the gate back to the verifier — the one agent who structurally
# cannot answer it. Delete that clause and the same ask routes to the lead.
#
# It is the DIVE-2089 shape and it is recursive: the better you describe the merge
# freeze you are trying to fix, the more reliably the gate to fix it misroutes. It
# fires hardest when urgency is highest, because that is when a filer explains the
# blockage in the ask.
#
# need.sh:2686 already states this distinction for the SIBLING axis — "THE ASK ONLY,
# never the title (DIVE-2224). A title is written to describe a DEFECT; only the ask
# can be a REQUEST." The same distinction is needed WITHIN the ask: a clause saying
# what is BLOCKED is not a request to unblock it by hand.
#
# THE FIX IS A DISCRIMINATOR, NOT A SHORTER LIST — deliberately, and the ticket
# forbids the other one. Every term stays in _GATE_PUSH_NOT_INERT_RX: it exists so a
# push ask that genuinely ALSO asks to merge or deploy keeps its routing and its
# DIVE-2629 tier-2 subject floor. What is added is the bounded set of FRAMES in
# which one of those terms is unambiguously a noun naming a blocked state. Those
# spans — and only those — are removed before the not-inert test, the same move
# DIVE-2629 makes on branch identifiers and for the same reason: grade the action
# the gate AUTHORISES.
#
# THREE PROPERTIES, all biased toward KEEPING the non-inert verdict:
#
#   1. LEADING WORD BOUNDARY, the DIVE-2301 wrapper. Without it "delegated" ends in
#      "gated", so "delegated release of branch X" contains "gated release" and a
#      real release request would be redacted away mid-word. Frames must start at a
#      word edge.
#   2. SPANS, NOT TERMS. Only the matched described-frame span is removed. A
#      requested action sitting BESIDE a described one survives, so one description
#      cannot launder a request next to it ("merge freeze is lifted, so merge it to
#      main after" is still NOT inert).
#   3. SCOPED TO THE NOT-INERT TEST. _GATE_PUSH_FOR_REVIEW_RX still reads the
#      original ask, so redaction can never push a text OUT of the class; and the
#      redacted string is discarded, so DIVE-2629's floor still reads the full
#      prose. Removing a span can only SHORTEN the text, which for the bounded
#      `\bto\b … main` clause can only make it match MORE readily — the safe
#      direction.
#
# BOTH AXES MOVE, BY CONSTRUCTION, and that is the point of doing it here:
# _gate_push_for_review_hit is shared with DIVE-2629's tier floor (need.sh:2696), so
# the routing and tier axes cannot end up disagreeing about what an inert push is.
# Graded on both axes in tests/gate_described_not_requested_unit.sh.

# DIVE-4001: THE SPEND SIGNAL that lets the bare noun `price|pricing` floor.
#
# THE DEFECT. The floor is a bare case-insensitive substring match over ask and
# title, so `price` cannot tell "approve this spend" from "a price is missing
# from our public pricing board". We SHIP a pricing product — /models and
# /tokenmaxxing exist to display prices — so every row about our own surface
# floored by TITLE, which a filer cannot word around without mistitling their own
# ticket. Measured 2026-09-06: DIVE-4000 ("a model on the public models board
# shows no price at all; this fills it in", an inert push-for-review approval)
# floored to tier 2 and reached the paired human, who could not delegate it.
#
# THE FIX IS A CONTEXT REQUIREMENT, NOT A REMOVAL. `price|pricing` stays in the
# floor. It simply stops firing on a field that carries NO spend signal at all —
# no currency figure, no money verb, no price-change verb. Every other money term
# (`\$[0-9]`, `billing`, `invoice`, `charge`, `payment`, `subscription`, `spend`,
# `refund`) keeps firing BARE and is untouched by this, so the classes DIVE-891
# named still floor on their own words.
#
# THE SIGNAL LIST IS DELIBERATELY OVER-INCLUSIVE, and that is the SAFE direction:
# it can only ever RE-ENABLE the floor, never fire on its own. A term wrongly in
# it costs a false positive (one appeal, see below); a term wrongly missing costs
# a false negative on the money class, which has the least escape. So it carries
# the price-CHANGE verbs (raise/lower/increase/discount/hike) as well as the
# spend verbs the ticket named, because "should we raise prices on the pro plan"
# names no currency figure and is exactly the brand/commercial call that must
# still reach a person — and, from the same audit, the COMMERCIAL OBJECTS a price
# is set against (plan / tier / seat / sku / contract / customer / enterprise /
# vendor / margin / deal), because "approve the new plan price" and "sign off on
# the enterprise price" name no verb and no figure either. What DIVE-4000's texts
# name instead is a model, a board, a catalog and a join — a datum, not a deal.
#
# FIELD-SCOPED, NOT PROXIMITY-SCOPED. The obvious shape is "a signal NEAR the
# term", and a bounded window is the one thing this file has been burned by twice
# (DIVE-1481's 20-char co-reference window; DIVE-2224's cross-seam join). A
# whole-field test needs no window arithmetic, cannot match across a seam
# (_gate_floor_axis already evaluates ask and title separately), and floors
# STRICTLY MORE than any window over the same list would.
#
# RESIDUAL, named so the next reader does not rediscover it as a surprise (dev3,
# DIVE-4001 iteration 1): a genuinely spend-shaped ask worded with the BARE noun
# and none of the signals above goes clean — "sign off on the new price", "set
# the price for the launch", "should we accept their price?". That is exactly the
# trade this row's correction specified (a spend signal in the field, not the bare
# noun), and it is bounded by the companion change: `price` is now APPEALABLE, not
# lowered — the floor still fires on every listed signal, and a missed one lands a
# tier-1 gate at a routed seat rather than nothing at all. Widen the list here if a
# real spend is ever measured slipping; do not widen it on a hypothetical.

  # NON-APPEALABLE list, so an ask that legitimately says "stop forging a
  # suppression" floored to tier 2 with no appeal path, on a word that has nothing
  # to do with press or money.
  #
  # The boundary is applied HERE, at the match site, and not by writing \b onto
  # each term in $_GATE_T2_FLOOR_RX. Two reasons, both measured:
  #
  #   1. $floor_rx is POLICY DATA and may have been replaced wholesale by a sealed
  #      constitution.yaml a few lines up. Anchoring the shipped default would
  #      leave the defect live in exactly the path where the policy is
  #      authoritative, and an org's own terms would still be substring matchers.
  #   2. \b CANNOT anchor the money terms. \b asserts a word/non-word transition,
  #      and '$' is not a word character, so `\b\$[0-9]` never matches: with a
  #      per-term \b, "approve $500 for ads" and "wire €900 to the vendor" stop
  #      flooring ALTOGETHER. That trades a false positive for a false NEGATIVE on
  #      the one class with no escape path. `(^|[^[:alnum:]_])` is a leading
  #      boundary that a non-word term can also sit behind, and it keeps both.
  #
  # LEADING only, deliberately: the terms are unanchored at the tail so inflections
  # keep matching (revoked, truncated, charges, pressing). Containment inside an
  # unrelated STEM is the defect; containment at the start of a longer word
  # (pressure, deleterious) still fires and is the accepted cost of that choice.
  #
  # DIVE-2629: an inert push-for-review ask NAMES A GIT BRANCH, and the branch name

# DIVE-2224 PART 2 — lodar answered A on 2026-07-28. The floor's SUBJECT is the ASK.
#
# WHY. A title cannot be a REQUEST. It is written at ticket-creation time to describe
# a DEFECT; the ask is written at gate-filing time to describe what is being asked
# for. Flooring on the title treats a description as a request, and the filer cannot
# reword their way out of it -- DIVE-2216 could not file a push gate AT ALL, because
# 'deleted' sits in its own title. Measured over the 177 filed gates carrying an ask:
# 40 match on the ask (unchanged), 15 match TITLE-ONLY (move to the lead), 122 match
# neither -- so this moves ~27% of human gates to the lead, and understates it,
# because gates that could never be filed never entered the count.
#
# THE FALLBACK IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT A FOOTNOTE (olivia's condition, adopted). A
# works only while the ask is a TRUTHFUL statement of the request. The failure case
# is a lazy filing -- ask "approve this", title "delete all customer data" -- where
# the title genuinely IS the only statement of the request. An ask that names nothing
# is a badly-filed gate, and the floor FAILS CLOSED on it rather than trusting the
# filer. Bias is deliberately toward NOT-substantive: a wrongly-floored gate costs
# one tap, a wrongly-unfloored one lets a destructive ask reach an agent.

# DIVE-1359: the ENG-SHIP gate class. An eng ship / merge / diff / deploy
# approval is NOT a human call — it is the org lead's (Marcus) to clear. But a

# which (a) pings the paired human and (b) is UNCLEARABLE by the lead, since
# tier-2 is human-only by system rule. Observed twice: dev (DIVE-1349/1314) +
# codex (DIVE-907) escalated eng ship approvals to the human. We classify these
# by kind and force them DOWN to a lead-routed tier-1 — the mirror of the T2
# floor (which forces true-human categories UP to tier-2). The true-human floor
# ALWAYS wins and is checked FIRST: an eng gate that also names money / secrets /
# destructive stays tier-2 (a "ship the pricing change" gate is still a
# human call). Bias, like the floor, is deliberate: a wrongly-classified eng gate
# costs the lead one clear; the floor guards the only genuinely-human direction.
# DIVE-1555: a delegated push-for-review (5dive push / DIVE-1376) is an eng-ship
# action — it pushes a FEATURE branch for PR review (no merge, no prod touch), so
# it must file as a lead-routed tier-1, not a tier-2 human-only approval that
# lands in the human's DM. `push to (main|prod|...)` deliberately does NOT match a
# feature-branch push-for-review, so name it explicitly here.
# DIVE-1698: a VERIFIED builder ship — "push the tested commit to GitHub + roll to
# the fleet" (DIVE-1674 telegram undefined-guard) — is the same eng-ship kind, yet
# it missed the classifier: `push to (main|prod|origin)` excludes "to GitHub", and
# `roll ?out` excludes "roll/rolling to the fleet". Both stayed at the approval
# tier-2 default → the human's DM. Add `push … github` and `roll … fleet` /
# `fleet roll` so a tested-code push+fleet-roll files as a lead-routed tier-1. The

# stays human), so these can only ever cost the lead one clear.

# --- DIVE-2093: say WHO the gate routed to and WHY, at FILE TIME --------------
#
# The routed `ok` line has always named the reviewer and the ROLE ("routed to
# main2 for verifier review"). What it never named is the PROPERTY that picked
# that reviewer, and that omission is the whole defect: three agents in 36 hours
# (dev3 on DIVE-2084, main on DIVE-2146, olivia right behind them; then main2 on
# DIVE-2798 and DIVE-2808) filed a gate asking for an ACTION and had it land on
# the loop's verifier, who could judge the work and could not perform the act.
# Every one of those cost a round trip, and none of them was visible on the
# board — a gate pending on the wrong principal renders exactly like a gate
# pending on the right one.
#
# The filer is the only party who knows what the ask actually needs, and the
# moment of filing is the only moment at which re-filing is free. So the fix is
# to hand them the routing basis right there instead of leaving them to infer it
# from an answer that never comes.
#
# `basis` is the property that chose the target, NOT the trigger that made the
# gate routable at all — those are different questions and the filer needs both.
# `basis` is `tasks.route_provenance` VERBATIM — the same value the row is stamped
# with, threaded from the one place it is computed rather than re-derived here.
# DIVE-2093 iteration 3, and the reason is a defect this function shipped with: it
# used to take a two-valued lead/verifier flag and print the ORG CHART sentence for
# everything that was not `verifier`. DIVE-3171 then added a THIRD route (the sealed
# standing lead, which fires precisely when the chart resolves NOBODY), so the
# catch-all asserted an `agents_org.reports_to` edge that by construction does not
# exist — a routing explanation naming the wrong property, which is this row's own
# defect class emitted by the fix for it.
#
# THE GENERAL RULE, and it is why the last arm reads the way it does: a catch-all in
# an EXPLANATION is not a default, it is an assertion about every case you did not
# enumerate. `*)` is safe when it says "some other reason"; it is a falsehood
# generator when it names a specific mechanism and cites a specific table. A
# diagnostic must degrade to UNKNOWN, never to the most common case — the same
# absent-vs-forbidden reasoning as DIVE-2318.

# requester is the beneficiary. The boundary is therefore deliberately narrow and
# the mechanism is deliberately visible in the record.
#
# WHAT IT ADDS: DIVE-1182/1243 already let the lead clear a gate that was ROUTED
# to them at filing time (routed_reviewer == the authenticated caller). That is
# the only lead-clear path today, so an engineering approval that reached the
# human WITHOUT routing — pref off, filer-is-lead, a re-route that NULLed the
# reviewer, or a gate filed before routing existed — is human-only forever, even
# though its entire content is a judgement the lead can make. Three of the 14
# gates in lodar's inbox on 2026-07-26 were exactly that. This predicate is the
# standing authority: no routing required, but every other guard stays.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT "another keyword match" (design note 1 on the ticket, and the
# DIVE-2089 trap): a keyword match here would be a false-NEGATIVE machine — the
# dangerous polarity, where the lead self-clears something that should have gone
# to the human. So vocabulary is never sufficient on its own. Eligibility is a
# CONJUNCTION of an unforgeable identity check, a structural type/tier check, a
# positive engineering classification, AND two independent exclusion tests. Text
# can only ever REMOVE authority here; the guards that GRANT it are structural.
#
# FAIL CLOSED (design note 2): every unknown answers "no". An empty ask, an empty
# or legacy-NULL tier, an unresolvable org lead, an unauthenticated caller, or a
# text that does not positively classify as engineering all deny. An
# unclassifiable gate is a human gate.

# DIVE-3228 — THE COMMENT AND THE CONDITION DISAGREED, AND THE CONDITION WON.
#
# `access` defaults to tier 2 (the `*) tier=2` arm at the type-default case below),
# and DIVE-1243 made it lead-clearable BY TYPE: it is routable regardless of tier,
# it bypasses the gate_builder_routing pref, and cmd_task_answer's
# designated-reviewer exception lists it alongside approval/manual. So filing one
# tells the filer it routed, and `routed_reviewer` really is set.
#
# Then the tier-2 floor in cmd_task_answer (`gtier == 2 && ! human`) refuses the
# routed lead's answer, and the DIVE-1437 escalation immediately below it is scoped
# `[[ $nt == approval || $nt == manual ]]` — `access` is not in that list, so it
# does not even get the escalation's tap button; it takes the original hard
# refusal. The comment eight lines above that condition asserts the opposite
# ("`access` is DELIBERATELY lead-clearable by DIVE-1243"), which is how this
# survived: every reader who checked the intent found it documented and correct.
#
# MEASURED, DIVE-3212 (ops -> main, 2026-08-11): filed --type=access, routed at
# main explicitly, `task answer` refused with "DIVE-3212 is a tier-2 human gate
# (access) — only a human can clear it; tap the button in Telegram". The filer did
# everything right and still produced a gate only lodar could clear, for a push to
# our own repo. It was already MOOT when it refused — the branch was pushed and
# PR #585 opened before the answer was attempted — so it sat in the human inbox
# describing work that was done.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT "let the lead clear tier 2". The exemption is re-derived FROM THE
# ROW rather than inferred from `_lead_clear` alone, and that is deliberate: relying
# on the file-time invariant ("a floored/pinned access gate never gets routed, so a
# routed one must be clean") is exactly the necessary-but-not-sufficient trap this
# same row already produced once — the six-harness population that was derived
# statically and measured to zero. A row written by an older build, or by any future
# path that sets routed_reviewer, must not inherit clearance from an argument about
# what cmd_task_need does today.
#
# So `access` at tier 2 is lead-clearable ONLY when the store can say it is tier 2
# for the one reason that carries no human class:
#   axis=type-default   -> 2 because `access` defaults to 2. Nobody chose it. ALLOW.
#   axis=pinned         -> the caller typed --tier=2. DIVE-1957: a hard-human
#                          contract no KIND-based override may cross. DENY.
#   axis=ask / title-fallback -> the T2 category floor fired on money / secrets /
#                          destructive / publish. DENY.
#   '' or NULL          -> a pre-DIVE-2615 row: the column was never written, so the
#                          reason is UNKNOWN. An unknown is not a type-default. DENY.
# and a declared human-class `--needs` (spend_authority / human_tap / secret_provision)
# denies on top of all of it — the filer STATING what the ask consumes outranks any
# inference about the tier (DIVE-2241).
#
# `secret` can never reach here: it is never routed, so `_lead_clear` is 0 for it by
# construction, and it is not this predicate's type anyway.

# DIVE-2099 iteration 2 — WHO holds the standing authority, anchored to a NAMED
# agent. lodar answered the tier-2 decision gate 2026-07-27 with
# `anchor-to-named-agent`, over `keep-chart-derived`.
#
# WHY THE ORG CHART CANNOT BE THE SOURCE (what iteration 1 got wrong): iteration 1
# resolved the holder live at clear time with `_gate_route_reviewer(filer)`, which
# reads `agents_org.reports_to`. DIVE-2124 put `require_root` on `org set`/`org rm`,
# but every agent on this host holds (ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL, so `sudo 5dive org set` is
# still reachable by any of them, and the column recording who wrote the row
# (`by_claimed`) is caller-supplied and explicitly labelled non-evidence
# (residual: DIVE-2131). Deriving the authority from a table the beneficiary can
# rewrite is a self-grant path on the very authority being granted: rewrite the
# chart to make yourself somebody's lead, then clear their gate as your own lead.
#
# THE ANCHOR: the agent NAMED in the constitution, trusted only when the on-disk
# constitution still matches the digest SEALED into the council lineage. This is
# the DIVE-1695 precedent, already load-bearing for the tier-2 hard-gate floor a
# few hundred lines up: the file is forgeable, the chain is not. An agent CAN
# `sudo` a new name into constitution.yaml — and the moment it does, the live
# sha256 stops matching the sealed one, `_council_constitution_drifted` says
# DRIFTED, and this function denies EVERYONE, including the name that was there
# before. Re-sealing is a constitutional-class council motion (2/3 + full quorum +
# founder veto), which no agent can convene against itself. So the write is not
# prevented, it is made self-defeating and tamper-evident — which is the property
# `require_root` alone does not have on a NOPASSWD:ALL host.
#
# FAIL CLOSED at every unknown: no council loader in scope, no sealed digest in
# the lineage (a bare constitution.yaml is then just a file anyone can write), a
# drifted file, a missing file, no `authority.eng_approval_lead` key, an empty
# value, or a value that is not a plain agent name -> no standing authority for
# anyone. Absence of a name is NOT "everyone" and is NOT "fall back to the chart".
#
# The org chart is still read for ROUTING (`_gate_route_reviewer`, unchanged) and
# the resolved filer is still recorded in the audit row — but neither is consulted
# for AUTHORITY any more. That separation is what the required test pins: mutate
# the chart after filing and the clear must still be refused.

# DIVE-2233 — the SECOND authority that was still derived from the org chart, and the
# one DIVE-2099 explicitly left alone ("the org chart is still read for ROUTING,

#
#   _gate_route_reviewer(filer)  reads agents_org.reports_to           (agent-writable)
#     -> UPDATE tasks SET routed_reviewer=<that name>                  (persisted at FILE time)
#       -> cmd_task_answer: nt in approval|manual|access AND actor == routed_reviewer
#          -> _lead_clear=1 -> that agent CLEARS A HUMAN-ONLY GATE
#
# So `sudo 5dive org set <victim> --manager=<me>` is a one-command self-grant: re-parent
# a builder, wait for (or provoke) their next ship gate, and clear it as their lead. The
# `require_root` on `org set` (DIVE-2124) does not help on a NOPASSWD:ALL host, and the
# `by_claimed` record of who wrote the row is caller-supplied and explicitly non-evidence.
#
# THE SPLIT THAT FIXES IT: routing and authorization are two different questions and only
# one of them has to be trustworthy.
#   - WHO IS PINGED stays chart-derived. That is a notification: routing a gate to the
#     wrong agent wastes their attention, it does not clear anything. Left unchanged so
#     re-parenting an org keeps working the way an org expects.
#   - WHO MAY CLEAR comes from these sealed bytes and nowhere else. An agent that writes
#     itself into somebody's `reports_to` still gets the ping and still cannot clear; the
#     gate falls through to the human exactly as if no lead had been named.
# Deriving BOTH from the chart is what made the write an authority grant. Deriving only
# the ping from it makes the same write inert.
#
# The seal is what carries the property, same as DIVE-2099: an agent CAN sudo a new name
# into constitution.yaml, and the moment it does the live sha256 stops matching the digest
# sealed in the council lineage, `_council_constitution_drifted` says DRIFTED, and this
# returns EMPTY — denying every lead including the legitimate ones. Re-sealing is a
# constitutional-class motion (2/3 + full quorum + founder veto) no agent convenes against
# itself. The write is not prevented, it is made self-defeating.
#
# FAIL CLOSED at every unknown (no council loader, no sealed digest, drift, missing file,
# no key, empty list, a malformed entry) -> NO name may lead-clear. Absence is not
# "everyone" and is NOT "fall back to the chart" — falling back would restore the exact
# path this closes. Note the operational consequence and that it is intended: on a box
# whose constitution does not name `gate_clear_leads`, routed lead-clear is INERT and
# every routed approval/manual/access gate waits for a human. That is a real posture
# change, so the refusal is logged with a REASON (see `_gate_clear_lead_denied_reason`)

# clear, not the paired human's. This class marks such asks so the caller
# downgrades them to a lead-routed tier-1, BUT ONLY when the SOLE reason the floor
# fired was an INTERNAL-destructive term (see _GATE_INTERNAL_DESTRUCTIVE_RX): a
# genuine prod/customer/infra destructive ask (drop a prod table, teardown infra,
# revoke a key, a dns/domain change) keeps those terms in the residual floor and
# stays hard-human. The class regex is deliberately NARROW — task-board / dev-
# workspace / recovery vocabulary that essentially never appears in an external
# destructive gate — so it is the real safety gate, not the term carve-out.

# 'delete the production database as part of board recovery' matches the

# carve-out, silently downgrading a PROD-destructive action to lead review — but
# 'delete' governs 'production database', not the board, so it must stay

# DIVE-2089: the DECLARED-DISCUSSION appeal — the fifth (and last text-driven)
# treatment of the T2 floor, and the only one that does NOT try to infer intent
# from vocabulary.
#
# THE DEFECT IT ANSWERS. The floor reads SUBJECT MATTER and picks the audience
# from it. dev3 filed a tier-1 SIZING gate on DIVE-2078 — "how should we model
# capability vs clearance" — and it was floored hard-human because the ask
# contains the words "credentials" and "privileged". The gate DISCUSSES
# credential handling as a design question and performs NO credential operation.
# Talking about credentials is not handling credentials.
#
# WHY NOT ANOTHER CLASS REGEX. eng-ship / curation / internal-ops all guess the
# KIND from more vocabulary, and DIVE-2099's design note 1 is explicit that
# adding a sixth guesser reproduces this bug with the polarity reversed — a
# false NEGATIVE there routes a real secret gate to an agent. There is no
# phrasing that reliably separates "discussing X" from "doing X": that is a fact
# about the filer's intent, not about the text. So we stop inferring and make
# the filer DECLARE it, on the record, with `--discusses="<why>"`.
#
# WHY A DECLARATION BEATS THE WORKAROUND IT REPLACES. dev3's actual remedy was
# to re-file with neutral wording, which is the worst outcome available: it
# works, it teaches the fleet to launder vocabulary to reach the right audience,
# and it is INVISIBLE — a laundered ask is byte-indistinguishable from an ask
# that never had the words. A declaration is the opposite on every axis: it is
# attributable to its filer, it is written into the gate the LEAD then reads, and
# it is audited. An agent that lies in a `--discusses` string is caught by the
# reviewer looking at the claim; an agent that launders is caught by nobody.
#
# THE SAFETY MODEL, and it is deliberately four-deep — the declaration is NOT
# trusted on its own:
#   1. `--type=decision` ONLY. approval / manual / secret / access DECLARE AN
#      ACTION by construction ("approve me doing X", "hand me the key"), so no
#      appeal exists for them. decision is the one type whose content is a
#      question. This is the ticket's own suggested shape: key off the declared
#      action, not the substrings.
#   2. Fires ONLY when the floor ACTUALLY over-fired (tier_floored==1), like
#      DIVE-1480 — a non-floored decision's routing is untouched.
#   3. NON-APPEALABLE CORE. Money, irreversible infra and real-comms terms can
#      never be appealed, no matter what is declared: we re-test the floor with
#      only the APPEALABLE terms stripped and refuse the appeal if anything
#      still trips it. A "should we refund these customers, A or B" decision is
#      a human call whether or not it is framed as design.
#   4. It downgrades to a LEAD-ROUTED tier-1, never to tier-0 and never to the
#      filer. A human is replaced by a reviewer, not by nobody; filer-is-lead ⇒
#      no reviewer ⇒ no appeal (a lead cannot self-appeal to themselves).
# Plus: an explicit --tier=2 vetoes it (DIVE-1957), and the appeal is refused
# LOUDLY rather than silently ignored, so a filer never believes an appeal
# applied when it did not.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT REMOVE — the DIVE-2146 pre-condition, discharged by
# construction rather than by enumeration. olivia's precondition on this ticket
# is that the floor is currently the SOLE ENFORCER of at least one directive
# (the self-restart confirm at projects/CLAUDE.md:13) and that a control which
# stops firing emits NO signal. This design cannot regress any such gate,
# because NOTHING here changes a gate's tier unless the filer PASSES A NEW FLAG.
# An agent that files the self-restart approval exactly as before gets the exact
# tier it got before — and `--discusses` is unavailable to it anyway, since that
# gate is --type=approval (rule 1). The directive still needs encoding as its own
# artifact; DIVE-2146 owns that arm and gates it on its own precondition.
#
# APPEALABLE: the vocabulary that routinely appears in DESIGN discussion of a
# category without any action being requested — secrets/credentials handling
# (2089's reported case), the content-publish-later terms DIVE-1381 already
# treats as over-firing, and the recoverable-destructive verbs DIVE-1480 does.
#
# DIVE-4001 adds `price|pricing`, moved OFF the non-appealable half. That
# asymmetry was backwards for us specifically: a `token` floor could be appealed
# and a `price` floor never could, while /models and /tokenmaxxing are pricing
# PRODUCTS, so every design discussion of our own surface floored permanently.
# This lowers nothing — the floor still fires, the gate still exists, it still
# needs clearing; it restores the appeal path `token` and `secret` already have.
# The money class is NOT carved out with it: `spend|billing|invoice|charge|
# payment|refund|subscription|\$[0-9]|€[0-9]` all stay non-appealable and all
# still fire bare, so an ask that actually moves money is refused an appeal on
# its own words. Companion change at _GATE_PRICE_SPEND_SIGNAL_RX makes the bare
# noun require a spend signal before it fires at all — the two are independent:
# this one makes a price false positive RECOVERABLE, that one makes it rarer.

# NON-APPEALABLE (everything else in the floor, stated positively so a future
# edit to the floor regex cannot silently widen what an appeal reaches): money,

# matches against it (grep the tree: one definition, zero uses). The non-appealable

# FULL floor, so the boundary fix at _gate_tier2_floor_hit is what actually stops
# 'suppression' from being read as the non-appealable 'press' in an appeal refusal.
# If this list is ever promoted to a live matcher it must go through the same
# leading-boundary wrapper and NOT per-term \b, which cannot anchor \$[0-9]/€[0-9]
# and would silently drop the money class out of the un-appealable half.
#
# The appeal path depends on an invariant this pair must keep: no APPEALABLE term

# the latter and hand an appeal to a class that has none. Asserted in

# ============================================================================
# DIVE-4176 — THE HUMAN-ASK READABILITY CHECK IS A REFUSAL, NOT A WARNING.
#
# lodar, 2026-08-12: "I cannot understand most of the tech stuff when I got to my
# human gate". The rule has been in CLAUDE.md since; the CODE has only ever
# warned (DIVE-3661, the ~15-word render-cut warning further down). A warning
# delivered to a HEADLESS filer is read by nobody, and the proof is this ticket's
# own parent: DIVE-4150 was warned that its 34-word ask "will render cut" and was
# filed anyway, unchanged. Advisory was the right call when the check was a
# render-budget hint; it is the wrong call for the only text the human sees.
#
# SCOPE IS THE LOAD-BEARING PART, and it is not "every gate". Replayed over
# gate_history, 30 days to 2026-09-09, 511 asks:
#
#   human-facing (tier 2)  165 of 191 refused (86%)
#   lead-facing  (tier 1)  264 of 319 refused (83%)
#
# The tier-1 number is why the refusal fires ONLY on a gate that reaches the
# paired human (tier 2, or a declared human capability). A tier-1 gate is read by
# an AGENT — a sha, a branch and a file path are the clearest thing you can write
# to one, and refusing 83% of lead-routed gates over vocabulary would bounce
# correct filings to satisfy a rule about a reader who is not on that gate. The
# DIVE-3661 warning still covers tier 1, where advisory is the right strength.
#
# THE 86% IS NOT A REDESIGN SIGNAL — the row required this be checked before
# shipping. The 26 tier-2 asks that survive are the lodar-readable corpus
# verbatim ("Two AI workers have been signed out since July. Sign them back in,
# or retire them?"), and the 165 refused are the machine-shaped ones the
# DIVE-4150 measurement already counted: 137 of 193 human-facing gates named a
# push, merge, PR, branch, diff, sudo, token, sha or a DIVE ident, the human
# answered 37, and the filing seat itself withdrew 135 after paging. The refusal
# does not red a legitimate historical filing; it reds the population that was
# already being retracted.
#
# WHY VOCABULARY IS A SAFE PREDICATE HERE AND IS NOT AT THE T2 FLOOR. The floor
# reads vocabulary where CATEGORY was meant, so it penalises the precise filer
# (DIVE-2629/4001, and the [[naming-your-blocker...]] wiki page). Here vocabulary
# IS the subject: the claim is not "this ask is about a sha", it is "this string
# contains a token the reader cannot parse". A false positive costs one rewrite
# of a sentence that had to be rewritten anyway; it never routes a gate to the
# wrong desk, and never lowers a tier.
#
# THE ESCAPE IS DECLARED, NOT INFERRED. `--ask-ok="<why>"` files anyway and is
# audited, same shape as --discusses (DIVE-2089) and --rubber-stamp-ok
# (DIVE-2848): a gate must never become unfileable (DIVE-2216), and an exception
# that leaves a row is countable, which an invisible reword is not.

# neighbours of each shape survive:
#   ident   DIVE-3164, CNCL-9, PR #566.
#   sha     hex >=7 that carries BOTH a digit and an a-f letter, so the token
#           budget '5000000' and the word 'deadbeef'-shaped prose are not shas.
#   path    an absolute path, a slash-token with a dot/hyphen/underscore in it

#           (origin/main), or a source-file extension. A bare two-word slash is
#           deliberately NOT matched: 'and/or', 'read/write' and '19/19' are

# DIVE-2848 — THE KEYSTROKE CAP ON RUBBER-STAMP GATES.
#
# lodar, 2026-08-06 04:11Z: "im fighting with unnecessary human gates for the past
# three weeks", after "im tired of rubber tapping". The policy that should have
# prevented it has been in CLAUDE.md since 2026-06-29, is unambiguous, and is
# fleet-visible. Measured over 2026-07-16..2026-08-07 anyway: of 107 human-answered
# JUDGMENT gates that carried a --recommend, 96 (90%) came back as the human tapping
# that same value. Only 7 gates in the whole window were keyword-floored to tier 2 —
# the rest of the tier-2 population is agents TYPING --tier=2 on decision, a type
# that defaults to 1. `--tier=0` was used 0 times in 346 gates.
#
# So this is not an intent problem and not a floor-heuristic problem. A policy is
# indexed by TOPIC (a bullet in a doc you read when thinking about gates); the act is
# a KEYSTROKE (you are mid-task, you type the flag). The two never meet. Same defect
# shape the filing cap already solved once: it does not ask agents to file fewer rows,
# it REFUSES at `task add` and names the exits.
#
# The rule encoded below: A GATE WHOSE RECOMMENDATION YOU ARE CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO
# WRITE IS A GATE YOU CAN TAKE. Writing --recommend is deciding; what remains is
# asking a person to agree with a decision already made, which is reassurance.
#
# DELIBERATELY OUT OF SCOPE of the refusal — each of these is a real tier 2:
#   * the T2 category floor (money / public comms / secrets / destructive). Those are
#     tier 2 on SUBJECT MATTER, the filer cannot lower them, and --discusses is their
#     own audited appeal. `tier_floored==1` excludes them here.
#   * a DECLARED --needs=human_tap|spend_authority|secret_provision (DIVE-2241) — that
#     names a capability the filer does not hold, which is the honest hard gate.
#   * manual / secret / access, which are tier 2 by TYPE. Those defaults are the other
#     half of this ticket and are NOT touched here: on --type=secret a tier-2 default
#     is correct and must stay permanent.

# recommendation. Prints "<taps> <total>"; prints "0 0" on any error, i.e. FAIL-OPEN,
# because the instance-level cap is the enforcing rail and a measurement that cannot
# run must not become a block nobody can explain.
#
# The tap test is SEMANTIC, not string equality, and that is load-bearing. This
# ticket's first measurement read 45% because it compared need_answer to recommend
# with `=`: on an approval the human's tap normalises to 'approved' while the
# recommendation is free text ("approve", "Push it", ...), so 45 of 47 genuine taps
# scored as overrides. lodar caught it himself ("i tap on recs much more... more like

# DIVE-3694 (ROADMAP #22) — AUTONOMY EARNED BY A MEASURED PER-FILER TRACK RECORD
#
# The claim: "when the asker has been right N times running, stop asking". It is
# the successor to ROADMAP #20 (DIVE-3693 / `task precedent` above), which was
# demoted because its mechanism keyed on the QUESTION repeating and the questions
# do not repeat — 322 distinct decision ask_shapes over 333 answered decision
# gates, so the strictest honest seed rule fires 0 of 204 tier-1 decision gates.
# Wiki: community/wiki/precedent-needs-a-repeat-rate-not-an-acceptance-rate.md.
#
# What DOES transfer is a property of the RECOMMENDATION, not of the question:
# over the 204 answered tier-1 decision gates carrying a --recommend that the
# store holds (union of `tasks` + `gate_history`, 2026-07-21..2026-08-23),
# **178 = 87.3%** came back as the answerer returning the filer's own
# recommendation. So this keys on the FILER'S TRACK RECORD.
#
# THE POPULATION CORRECTION, and it is load-bearing — measure it before you read
# the release note. Of those 204 tier-1 decision gates, **only 11 were answered
# by a human at all**; 193 were answered by a ROUTED AGENT LEAD (DIVE-1145
# builder-gate routing sends a tier<2 decision to the org lead first). Split:
# agent-answered 169/193 = 87.6%, human-answered 9/11 = 81.8%. So promotion here
# removes a LEAD ROUND-TRIP in ~19 of every 20 cases, not a human tap. That is
# still the numerator of `1 - asks/shipped` and still real — an inbound a2a costs
# the recipient a full context reload (projects/5dive/CLAUDE.md) — but the
# feature must not be described as "stop asking the human". It is not.
#
# ATTRIBUTION IS DELIBERATELY NARROW. `gate_history` carries no filer column, so
# a history row can only be attributed through its task's CURRENT
# `tasks.gate_filed_by` — which is the wrong seat whenever a gate was re-filed by
# someone else. An autonomy grant handed to a seat on ANOTHER seat's record is
# the exact failure this feature cannot have, so the record reads `tasks` ONLY,
# where the filer is stamped on the row that carries the answer. Measured cost of
# that choice, by replay: union attribution would fire 33/204, tasks-only fires
# 15/204. We take the smaller number.
#
# THE RATE IS COMPUTED STARTS-WITH, NEVER `=`. Answers are routinely the
# recommendation plus commentary (`merge — ALREADY DONE`, `ship — verified in
# source`), and equality undercounts the same population by ~11-19 points
# (139/203 = 68.5% vs 177/203 = 87.2%). A threshold set against the equality
# number would be set against a wrong number.
#
# DEMOTION IS THE LOAD-BEARING HALF. Promotion needs THREE things at once and
# loses on any one of them: rate over the window, a minimum COUNT, and a clean
# recent streak. The streak is what makes a reversal bite IMMEDIATELY — one
# answer that does not return the recommendation lands at the head of the window
# and the streak test fails on the very next gate, without waiting for the
# windowed rate to drift. It stays failed until the seat has _GATE_RECORD_STREAK
# fresh concordant answers again.
#
# An OVERTURN of an auto-applied gate is covered by the same query and needs no
# second mechanism: this path never mints a human nonce and never claims a human
# answered, so if a human or lead later answers that row, `need_answered_by`
# becomes their stamp, the row enters the window like any other, and a
# non-concordant overturn breaks the streak exactly as a fresh reversal does.
#
# ABSENCE OF A RECORD IS NEVER A GOOD RECORD. The count floor is checked before
# the rate, and an unknown/empty filer returns "0 0 0" — a new seat is
# un-promoted by construction, and every error path in the read below FAILS
# CLOSED to that same value (the opposite posture from `_gate_tapback_stats`,
# which fails OPEN because a measurement that cannot run must not become a block;
# here a measurement that cannot run must not become a GRANT).

    #                      which is precisely the DIVE-2133 shape.
    # A fifth authorizer would have fixed only the first, so this REPLACES the principal.

    # THE SHAPE IS DELIBERATELY STRICTER THAN :6154's, which is the one amendment olivia

    # authorizing on that would silently RE-ADMIT the reassigned-holder route in exactly
    # the state where both other columns are empty — the route we are removing. So the
    # authorization site stops at created_by. Two shapes for two jobs, deliberately: the
    # display readers keep their assignee rung, and what this ticket retires is THREE
    # shapes for ONE job. Authorizer-existence does not rest on that rung anyway —

  # DIVE-2354 — THE TWO ORDERS A GATE CAN BE IN, as data on the row.
  #
  # THE DEFECT, measured on the first run of the DIVE-2348 customer-feedback loop:
  # a gate worded "lodar approves the reply BEFORE it is sent" cannot be satisfied
  # honestly once the send has already happened (emails 13:27/13:30, loop fired the
  # drafting step 13:40). Answering it asserts a before-the-fact approval that did
  # not occur; cancelling it erases the decision point AND, on that run, deleted
  # marketing's escalation path for a genuinely unapproved second email; leaving it
  # open reads as a bypassed human. Nobody bypassed anyone and the record said
  # somebody had. It recurs by construction: these loops race a LIVE Telegram
  # thread, so a loop materialised from the board is routinely behind the
  # conversation. That is the normal case for anything customer-facing, not a
  # timing accident.
  #
  # THE FIX IS A THIRD STATE, not a new verb. `confirm-after-send` records that the
  # tap came AFTER the action — a RATIFICATION. It is not "approved" and must never
  # render as it (same shape as unreadable-vs-absent, DIVE-2327, and NOT-REACHED-vs-
  # pass, DIVE-2039). NULL is the third value: a gate filed before this shipped
  # does not say which order it was, and inferring one for it would manufacture the
  # very claim this ticket is about.
  #
  # WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, deliberately: nothing here clears anything. The human tap
  # stays mandatory in BOTH modes. `confirm-after-send` is `--type=approval` only —
  # approval is human-class (root-gated in cmd_task_answer, excluded from precedent
  # auto-clear by _gate_human_class), so restricting the mode to it makes
  # "ratification requires a person" true BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by a rule
  # someone has to keep. A `decision` that already happened re-files as an approval;
  # that is the same direction [[standing-authorisation-is-per-thread-dive2353]]

  # DIVE-2012: THE VERIFIER-SCOPING DEAD-END, made visible.
  #
  # The shape: the MAKER of a live maker→verifier loop files a `decision` gate
  # asking the VERIFIER to scope that task's own acceptance criteria — a question
  # whose only correct answerer is that verifier — and the ask NARRATES the work
  # under test, so the T2 category floor fires on the narration. Measured on the
  # ticket's own repro: tier goes to 2, the DIVE-1495 verifier-route below is
  # guarded on `tier != 2` so it never runs, `routed_reviewer` stays NULL, and the
  # DIVE-1117 provenance floor then refuses the verifier's answer. Net: the paired
  # human is pinged for a call that was never theirs AND the designated answerer is
  # locked out. dev's actual remedy on DIVE-1968 was to message olivia out of band.
  #
  # WHY THIS IS A WARNING AND NOT A SIXTH DOWNGRADE CLASS. The ticket asks for an
  # exemption ("routed decision gates should skip the floor"). Building one means a
  # sixth vocabulary guesser, and DIVE-2099's design note is explicit that adding
  # one reproduces this bug with the polarity REVERSED — a false negative there
  # routes a real money/secret ask to whichever agent happens to be grading the
  # ticket, which is the exact defect DIVE-2241 had just closed. The appeal
  # DIVE-2089 shipped is the supported answer and it already lands correctly:
  # `--discusses` downgrades to tier 1, and because the verifier-route below runs
  # AFTER every downgrade class, the gate then routes to the VERIFIER rather than
  # the lead. Measured: tier=1, routed_reviewer=<verifier>, human not pinged.
  #
  # So the residual defect is not the tier — it is that the remedy is INVISIBLE at
  # exactly the moment it is needed. `--discusses` landed after this ticket was
  # filed, the floor's own warning never mentions it, and nothing tells the filer
  # that the agent they are trying to reach is one flag away. An undiscoverable
  # remedy is indistinguishable from no remedy, which is why this ticket exists.
  #
  # The trigger is STRUCTURAL, never vocabulary: a live loop (both ends present),
  # the filer IS the maker, the verifier is someone else, and the type is the one
  # type an appeal exists for. It changes NO tier and NO route — a floored gate
  # still reaches the human, and the floor is untouched. It only ensures the filer
  # is told, on the record, who they were trying to reach and how to reach them.

  # ORDERING IS THE WHOLE FIX, and getting it wrong was worse than not fixing it. The

  # having ALREADY written need_type/ask/tier — leaving exactly the half-armed tier-2
  # gate it refuses to create, while telling the caller it had failed. Caught by arm M2
  # of gate_t2_nonce_proof_unit ("no half-filed gate is left behind"), which is the arm
  # I nearly did not write because the refusal "obviously" prevented the state.

  # WHY IT MUST FAIL CLOSED. An empty mint used to be silent: no UPDATE, hash NULL, gate
  # files normally, no warning and no audit row — indistinguishable from a properly
  # minted gate. Survivable while nothing read the column; NOT survivable once the
  # tier-2 floor treats a NULL hash as "skip the check", because then a box with a
  # broken RNG has no floor while every gate on it still LOOKS protected. That is
  # DIVE-2131 restated. `_human_nonce_verify` already fails closed on a missing hash;
  # the floor inverted that into a fail-open by skipping, so the refusal belongs HERE,
  # where the absence is created, not there, where it is only observed.
  #
  # Scoped to tier 2 deliberately: for the other human types a NULL hash still means
  # what it always meant and DIVE-916's verify path fails closed on it unchanged, so
  # widening this would break gate filing for no security gain. With the /dev/urandom

  # DIVE-3481 — THE INERT PUSH-FOR-REVIEW CLEARS AT FILING. NOBODY IS PINGED.
  #
  # lodar, 2026-08-16, on DIVE-3474's approval ping to main: "why dev2 cannot do
  # delegated push himself and burns your token for approval?" Every inert
  # push-for-review costs one lead clear, and a clear on a NON-FRESH seat re-sends that
  # seat's whole session window — the most expensive event that can happen to it.
  #
  # THE MEASUREMENT THAT LICENSES THIS IS CLASS-SPECIFIC, not the fleet number. Over
  # the whole gate_history (528 gates carrying an ask), 166 classify INERT under
  # `_gate_push_for_review_hit`. Of those, 110 were answered; 101 carried a
  # recommendation, and ALL 101 came back applying it. Zero disagreements, ever.
  # Contrast the fleet-wide figure DIVE-3474 arm 2 correctly refused to auto-apply on:
  # 54 of 121. A gate that disagrees with its filer 55% of the time is doing real work;
  # this subclass has never once disagreed across 101 answers.
  #
  # THE FILING ROW'S PREMISE WAS WRONG, AND THE CORRECTION MAKES THE CASE STRONGER.
  # It was filed as "the 48h TTL grants this anyway, so the ping buys latency only".
  # It does not: `_hb_gate_ttl_sweep` excludes `need_type IN
  # ('approval','secret','manual','access')` (DIVE-2235), and 143 of the 166 are
  # type=approval — the type a push gate MUST take (DIVE-3088), and the only family
  # `lead:` provenance is mintable on (DIVE-2004). An unanswered push gate therefore
  # does not auto-apply at 48h or ever; it sits open, and 45 of the 166 still do. The
  # lead clear is LOAD-BEARING today, so this is a NEW grant rather than a TTL dropped
  # to zero, and it is written narrower for exactly that reason.
  #
  # WHY THIS IS NOT DIVE-3474 ARM 2 ("do not auto-apply a routed gate"). That arm is
  # about the general judgment gate and its 54-of-121 is the reason. This is ONE
  # classified subclass with its own 101-of-101, whose ask is FAILED CLOSED by the
  # shared `_gate_push_for_review_hit` predicate — the same one DIVE-2629's tier floor
  # and DIVE-3117's routing floor use, so a third axis cannot end up disagreeing with
  # them about what an inert push is. An ask naming a merge/deploy/land-to-main is not
  # inert and never reaches here.
  #
  # EVERY GUARD, AND WHY EACH IS THE NARROW FORM:
  #   1. type == approval ONLY. Not decision (a decision auto-clear could not authorize
  #      a push anyway — broker_gate_check wants a routed reviewer plus a corroborating
  #      uid), not manual/access, never secret. approval is where the measured
  #      population lives and the only type this can produce a usable clear on.
  #   2. tier==1, tier_floored==0, tier_arg!=2. The T2 category floor (money, secrets,
  #      destructive, public comms) is resolved ABOVE and wins — DIVE-1555/1698's
  #      true-human floor is untouched — and an explicitly pinned --tier=2 still stands.
  #   3. _needs_human==0. A DECLARED capability (DIVE-2241) is the honest hard gate and
  #      outranks any classification made off the ask's shape.
  #   4. gate_mode != confirm-after-send. The same refusal tier-0 already makes above:
  #      ratifying an action already taken, with nobody involved, records no decision.
  #   5. A --recommend THE FILER TYPED (`recommend_arg`, not `recommend`). By this point
  #      `recommend` may have been PREFILLED from a precedent (OSS-11/20/21) that nobody
  #      wrote, and auto-applying a machine's prefill through a second auto-clear is two
  #      automated decisions stacked with no author between them. Same variable and the
  #      same reason as DIVE-2848's cap. Caught by this ticket's own harness: the
  #      no-recommend arm auto-cleared on a prefill inherited from an earlier fixture.
  #   6. ROW STATE, NOT PROSE (DIVE-3266): the row must carry a `Branch:` binding, read
  #      through the SAME `_push_branch_from_body` that `5dive push` acts on, and that
  #      branch must not be a protected ref. This is the adopted design's
  #      "non-protected ref" arm, and it is checkable at filing where the REPO is not:
  #      no row carries a repo binding, `5dive push` resolves the repo from the work
  #      tree at act time and its App token is installation-scoped, so "a repo we own"
  #      is enforced DOWNSTREAM by the executor and is deliberately not re-derived here.
  #      Stated rather than quietly dropped.
  #   7. The closure MUST SIGN — see below.
  #
  # THE SIGNATURE IS THE WHOLE DESIGN, AND A FAILURE TO MINT IT MUST NOT DEGRADE INTO A
  # CLEARED GATE. `broker_gate_check` refuses an unsigned closure outright, so a gate
  # self-cleared without one is a push refused later, on someone else's round-trip,
  # with the lead who could have cleared it already skipped — STRICTLY WORSE than
  # today's ping. So the signature is minted FIRST and an empty one falls straight
  # through to the normal routing below, i.e. exactly today's behaviour. A cli-scoped
  # seat with no `5dive gate-proof sign` sudo keeps its lead clear rather than losing
  # it. Same mint the DIVE-756 answer path uses (root in-process, else the root-only
  # verb over sudo), because two ways to sign a closure are two things that can drift.
  #
  # PROVENANCE IS MINTED, NOT SIDESTEPPED (DIVE-2004): `auto:pfr`, a value of its own,
  # so this auto-clear stays COUNTABLE and is never confused with a lead's tap
  # (`lead:*`), a human's (`human:*`), the TTL's (`auto:ttl`) or tier-0's (`auto:t0`).
  # broker.sh authorizes it for approval gates ONLY, and the closure signature — taken
  # over need_answered_by and verified by the ROOT executor at push time — is what
  # makes a raw-DB forge of the string fail, the same argument DIVE-1555 made for
  # `lead:*`. uid 0, like the TTL sweep: no human was involved and none is claimed.

  # gates answered by a VERIFIED human (see below) that were NOT themselves fuzzy-

  # need_answer, within
  # 90d, precedent tier >= 1, and ZERO contradicting human answers on that shape in
  # 90d (i.e. exactly ONE distinct human answer). On qualification we clear via the
  # SAME immediate direct-write path as tier-0/auto:ttl (never cmd_task_answer, so
  # NO human nonce is ever minted), provenance 'auto:precedent', precedent_ref = the
  # most-recent qualifying gate. The digest surfaces it through the auto:* Auto-
  # cleared section with the precedent citation (DIVE-891 path). Secret gates and
  # T2 provably never reach here; pref OFF is exact pre-OSS-21 behaviour.

  # DIVE-2235 changes the SEED TEST, and this is the subtle half of the ticket.
  # The old filter was `need_answered_by LIKE 'human:%'`, with a comment saying
  # it excludes every auto:* seed — true, and it does stop the auto writers
  # compounding. But `human:<name>` is a SELF-DECLARATION written from the
  # caller's own username: on DIVE-2224 two agent self-clears were stamped
  # `human:olivia` and would have QUALIFIED AS HUMAN PRECEDENT. The guard built
  # to stop laundering was checking the one field that cannot be trusted. So the
  # seed now additionally requires a per-gate human nonce to have been minted and
  # survived to the answer (human_nonce_hash non-empty — _gate_archive_and_clear
  # nulls it on a re-file, so it can only be the nonce this answer was given).
  #
  # HONEST CONSEQUENCE, stated rather than discovered later: combined with the
  # class guard, the only class that still reaches here is 'decision', and
  # decision gates do not mint a nonce (_gate_human_class's list is the mint
  # list). So precedent auto-clear is INERT until decision gates mint — that is
  # the v0.18 "proof of who" work. Inert is the correct direction for a pref

  #
  # Placed HERE, after the tier-0 return, after the T2 floor, after the OSS-21
  # precedent block and after the main gate write, for the same reason the
  # precedent block is: it can only ever act on a gate that has ALREADY resolved
  # to tier 1 by every rule that already existed. Nothing above changes.
  #
  # WHAT IS REFUSED, and these are refusals not deferrals (row scope):
  #   * `approval`, `secret`, `manual` — human BY TYPE. `_gate_human_class` is
  #     asserted directly rather than inferred from the tier, and the type is
  #     pinned to `decision` on top of it. A track record is not a CAPABILITY: no
  #     volume of prior yeses hands an agent a browser tap or spend authority
  #     (the DIVE-2248 shape).
  #   * every tier-2 gate — `tier==1` plus `tier_arg != 2` (an explicit
  #     --tier=2 is the filer's hard-human contract, DIVE-1957) plus
  #     `tier_floored == 0` (the money/destructive/public-comms subject floor).
  #     Tier-2 means *an agent cannot*, not *an agent is unsure*.
  #   * a DECLARED --needs=<capability> (DIVE-2241) — the honest hard gate.
  #   * question-similarity matching. That is #20, measured to reach ~0, parked
  #     on DIVE-3693. There is deliberately NO ask_shape read anywhere in this
  #     block, and there must never be one: this row must not quietly re-acquire
  #     the mechanism it was opened to replace.
  #
  # PROVENANCE IS MINTED, NOT SIDESTEPPED (DIVE-2004): 'auto:record', a value of
  # its own, never confused with a human's tap (`human:*`), a lead's (`lead:*`),
  # the TTL's (`auto:ttl`), tier-0's (`auto:t0`) or the push-for-review
  # auto-clear's (`auto:pfr`). It is not `human:%`, so a loop approval can never
  # be advanced through it (_task_loop_advance requires human:*), and
  # `_gate_record_stats` excludes `auto:%` from its own window so an auto-apply
  # can never feed the record that produced it.
  #
  # THE CITATION RIDES THE GATE. The record that licensed the clear is written to
  # the audit row, the ledger detail and the success line, so a wrong auto-clear
  # is findable by exactly the query that would have prevented it.
  #
  # REVERSIBLE WITHOUT A RELEASE: pref `track_record`, default ON — like
  # `pfr_autoclear` and unlike `precedent_autoclear`, because this one IS the
  # deliverable rather than an experiment. `5dive task track-record off` restores

  # DIVE-1145: ship-gating routing. Root-cause fix for builders over-filing
  # gates straight to the human (DIVE-1127/1142). Before the human ping, route a
  # NON-true-human builder gate to the org lead first, as an agent handoff. Gated
  # on pref `gate_builder_routing` (default OFF — same ship-safe posture as
  # OSS-21 precedent_autoclear; the lead flips it on after reviewing this diff).
  # Scope is deliberately DECISION-only in v1: decision gates are agent-clearable
  # (tier 1, no human_nonce) so the lead can actually resolve them, whereas
  # approval/manual/secret are enforced human-only by `task answer` (DIVE-1117
  # provenance floor) — routing those to an agent-reviewer needs the floor to
  # trust a designated reviewer, a deeper change deferred to a follow-up. We
  # never route a tier-2 gate — whether floored (true-human category: money/
  # destructive/secret, per _gate_tier2_floor_hit) OR filed with an
  # explicit --tier=2 (the caller's hard-human contract; 2 = never auto-applies,
  # always pings the human). Guarding on the EFFECTIVE tier (tier != 2) subsumes
  # the floor, since a floored gate always sets tier=2, and closes the hole where
  # `--type=decision --tier=2` with no floor keyword left tier_floored=0 and
  # silently routed past the human. We also never route one filed BY a lead
  # (_gate_route_reviewer returns empty → falls through to the human, which is
  # also how the lead re-escalates). Reviewer notify is best-effort + detached so
  # the 45s tmux-inject wait never blocks or fails the already-committed gate.
  # DIVE-1182 closes the DIVE-1145 gap: a builder's ship-gate is filed as
  # `approval` (or `manual`), NOT `decision`, so v1 left it human-only — it pinged
  # lodar instead of being clearable by the org lead (Marcus). We now route
  # approval/manual too, so a NON-true-human builder gate reaches the lead first.
  # `secret` is deliberately EXCLUDED (a secret must be delivered by a human,
  # never an agent), and tier-2 gates are never routed (guarded by tier != 2,
  # which subsumes the true-human category floor: money/destructive/secret).
  # Unlike decision (agent-clearable by type), approval/manual are human-only in
  # cmd_task_answer; routing them therefore PERSISTS routed_reviewer, the single
  # basis for the designated-reviewer floor exception there — so the exception is
  # scoped to exactly this routed gate + this reviewer, and every un-routed
  # approval/manual gate stays hard-human (DIVE-391/515/516 boundary intact).
  # Routability differs by type because of the tier-2 defaults:
  #   decision — defaults to tier 1, so `tier != 2` cleanly means "not pinned/
  #     floored hard-human" (subsumes explicit --tier=2 AND the category floor,
  #     which already ran above for tier<2).
  #   approval/manual — default to tier 2, so the effective tier can't discriminate.
  #     Route them UNLESS the caller EXPLICITLY pinned --tier=2 (hard-human
  #     contract) OR the ask/title hits the true-human category floor (money/
  #     destructive/secret) — the same floor decision that gates a decision,
  #     re-run here because the tier==2 short-circuit above skipped it for these.
  #   secret — never routable (must be delivered by a human).
  #
  # DIVE-1495: verifier-route. When the task carries a maker→verifier loop whose
  # VERIFIER is a distinct fleet agent, a decision/approval gate the maker files
  # is really a question FOR that verifier — not the paired human (CNCL-9: dev, as
  # maker, filed `task need --type=decision` to ask main the verifier and it
  # pinged lodar). Route it to the verifier's agent-send rail: they clear it via
  # `task answer` (already allowed for a decision; for approval the routed_reviewer
  # persisted below authorizes them, DIVE-1182). Intrinsic to the KIND, so it
  # bypasses the gate_builder_routing pref like eng-ship/curation. Never fires when
  # the filer IS the verifier (self-route — e.g. the max_iters escalation files
  # its manual gate --from the verifier) or on secret/manual/access. We still guard
  # tier!=2 so a money/brand/destructive decision stays human even inside a loop.
  # DIVE-2241: re-assert the declared human class AFTER every downgrade kind has

  # quinn stated it exactly on DIVE-2183: cannot approve a push before reading the
  # diff, cannot read the diff until it is pushed. Measured FOUR times on
  # 2026-08-09/10 (DIVE-3113, DIVE-2130, DIVE-2183, DIVE-2192), every one blocking a
  # real push, every one cleared by hand from the root seat.
  #
  # THE TEST AT THE KEYSTROKE: if this gate clears, does the answerer GAIN the thing
  # they needed in order to answer it? If yes, it is a cycle. Route it to the lead —
  # the one seat that can authorise the push and is not the party blocked by it. The

  # and it is the sharper one). The TIER machinery is correct — DIVE-2629 already put
  # a floor on the tier axis of this exact gate class (branch names stop forcing T2)
  # and it produced tier 1 on all four instances. What was missing is the SIBLING
  # floor, on routing: `floor_provenance=axis=none` on all four, i.e. nothing
  # engaged. DIVE-2629 left routed_reviewer EMPTY (no agent can clear it); this left
  # it equal to the GRADER (the one agent who cannot answer it). Same symptom, and a
  # tier-axis fix cannot reach the second case — which is why 2629 shipping did not
  # prevent four occurrences of 3117 in one day.
  #
  # THE ASK ONLY, never the title (DIVE-2224). A title is written at ticket-creation
  # time to describe a DEFECT; only the ask can be a REQUEST. This very ticket is
  # titled "push-for-review gate routes to the loop VERIFIER…", so a title-reading
  # classifier would strip the verifier off every genuine question filed on it. The
  # negative control is graded in tests/gate_verifier_route_unit.sh.
  #
  # `_gate_push_for_review_hit` fails closed and is the SAME predicate DIVE-2629's
  # tier floor uses, so the two axes cannot disagree about what an inert push is: a
  # push ask that also names a merge/deploy/land-to-main is NOT inert, keeps its
  # existing routing, and keeps flooring on its subject matter.

  # DIVE-3171 — EVERY GATE THE ORG ROOT FILES REACHES THE HUMAN BY CONSTRUCTION.
  #
  # `_gate_route_reviewer` walks UP the chart — reports_to, then the coordinator/root —
  # skipping any candidate equal to the filer. For the ROOT of the chart BOTH candidates
  # are the filer, so the walk falls off the end empty and the gate drops to the human
  # ping. Not intermittently, and not about any one gate's subject: it is every gate the
  # root ever files. DIVE-2612 already wrote the shape down from the FILER's side (its
  # warn text: "for the root of the chart the coordinator fallback resolves to
  # themselves"); this is the routing half of the same fact, which that ticket described
  # and did not fix. lodar, 2026-08-10, in the third week of it: "why still this goes to
  # me????? i was complaining for 3 weeks already".
  #
  # WHAT MAKES IT INVISIBLE: for every other seat the same code is correct, and the root
  # is the one seat that files engineering gates while sitting ABOVE the engineering lead.
  #
  # THE SAME PREDICATE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE SAME DECISION. DIVE-2099 gave a NAMED agent
  # STANDING authority over tier-1 engineering approvals, and `_gate_lead_standing_eligible`
  # already decides whether a given gate is in scope. So `cmd_task_answer` ALREADY knows
  # this gate is lead-clearable while the router does not — and a gate a lead is ALLOWED
  # to clear must not be DELIVERED to a human. The predicate is REUSED verbatim rather
  # than restated: two copies of "is this lead-clearable" are two things that can
  # disagree, and the dangerous direction of disagreement is the router handing an agent
  # a gate the answer path will then refuse.
  #
  # SEALED SOURCE, NEVER THE CHART. The fallback holder is `_gate_standing_lead` — the
  # agent named in the constitution, trusted only while the live bytes still match the
  # digest sealed into the council lineage. `agents_org` is agent-writable on a
  # NOPASSWD:ALL host, which is exactly why DIVE-2099/2233 anchored authority to the seal;
  # resolving THIS fallback from the chart would hand back the self-grant path they closed
  # (re-parent yourself above the root, receive the root's gates). Note the direction the
  # widening runs: the standing lead can ALREADY clear these gates unrouted (the DIVE-2099
  # branch ignores `routed_reviewer` entirely), so this moves who is PINGED and shown the
  # gate, never who may answer it.
  #
  # NARROW, AND FAIL CLOSED THREE WAYS — the ticket's negative arm is "do NOT widen this
  # to route ALL unrouteable gates to the lead":
  #   1. only when the chart resolves NOBODY. A filer who has a lead keeps that lead, and
  #      a `decision` the root files (agent-clearable by type already) is untouched.
  #   2. only when `_gate_lead_standing_eligible` says yes — `approval`, tier exactly 1, a
  #      POSITIVE engineering classification, minus the tier-2 floor and the deny list. A
  #      money/secret/brand/customer-box/tier-2 gate filed by the root still reaches the
  #      human. That is the arm that stops this becoming a way to launder a hard gate past
  #      a person, and it is why the eligibility predicate is the whole condition rather
  #      than a piece of it.
  #   3. only when the seal resolves a plain name that is NOT the filer. Drifted, unsealed,
  #      no `authority.eng_approval_lead` key, an empty value, no council loader in scope,
  #      or the root IS the named lead -> nothing -> the gate falls through to the human
  #      exactly as it does today. Fail closed, same direction as everything it reuses.
  #
  # The verifier route wins where it fired: that gate already has an agent routee, so this
  # is not the "nobody" case.
  #
  # `_sr_unrouteable` / `_sr_outcome` exist so the DECLINING branch is countable too.
  # The three weeks this ticket is about were invisible in the store: an unrouted gate
  # simply pinged the human and left no row saying a route had been ATTEMPTED and refused.
  # A fix that only records its successes leaves the next regression with nothing to count

  # DIVE-3266: ROUTE ON ROW STATE, NOT ON THE ASK'S PROSE.

  # `_eng_ship` is a regex over the ask and the title, and with gate_builder_routing
  # OFF (the default) it is the ONLY live route for an ordinary builder ship gate.
  # Miss the regex and `routed_reviewer` stays NULL, which is the first clause of
  # cmd_task_inbox's human predicate: an unrouted gate IS a founder gate. Measured
  # 2026-08-11 filing DIVE-3224's own push gate — "open both PRs" lowercases to
  # `prs` and the member is `\bpr\b`, so the word boundary fails on a sentence that
  # was entirely about pushing a branch and opening PRs.
  #
  # A `Branch: <name>` line is the opposite kind of input: STRUCTURED STATE, written
  # deliberately by `task set-branch` / `task add --branch` and validated to a git
  # ref-name there. It is the same binding `5dive push` requires before it will push
  # this row, so a branch-bound row IS a ship handoff whatever the ask's wording is.
  # Read the binding; do not parse prose for it.
  #
  # NOT a widened regex (`prs`, `PR's`, `pull-request`, the next synonym — unbounded,
  # and each addition looks locally correct). This removes the class for rows that
  # already record the answer instead of enlarging the classifier.
  #
  # Scoped to ROUTING ONLY, deliberately. It does NOT feed the DIVE-1359 tier
  # downgrade: tier decides CLEARANCE, routing decides WHO IS WOKEN, and widening a
  # tier control to unblock a routing complaint is how a safety control gets widened
  # mid-ship. Same guards as eng-ship (tier_floored=0, the three routable types), and
  # the DIVE-1957 `--tier=2` veto plus the DIVE-2241 `_needs_human` backstop both run

  # only finds out later, from a refusal that reads as if the answerer was at
  # fault. If the ask is push-for-review shaped, say so now, while the filer is
  # still standing here and re-filing costs nothing. Deliberately narrow: the ask
  # must LOOK like a push gate, the type must be the one push cannot attribute, and
  # the gate must be unrouted — a warning that fires on ordinary decisions would be
  # wallpaper (DIVE-1955).
  #
  # DIVE-2612 extends this, and it is two separate defects — both found by grading
  # DIVE-2610, a tier-1 eng-ship APPROVAL filed by the org root that came out
  # unrouted, pinged the human, and could then be lead-cleared by nobody.
  #
  #   1. THE SCOPE WAS INVERTED. An unrouted `decision` is answerable by ANY agent;
  #      an unrouted `approval`/`manual` is answerable by NO agent — cmd_task_answer's
  #      provenance floor makes those types human-only, and routed_reviewer is the
  #      SOLE basis for the designated-reviewer exception to it. The warning fired
  #      for the recoverable case and stayed silent for the unrecoverable one.
  #   2. THE REMEDY TEXT WAS FALSE FOR THE ONE FILER IT COULD NOT HELP. "Re-file
  #      with --type=approval (it routes to the org lead ...)" assumes the org
  #      resolver returns somebody. For the ROOT of the org chart it never can:
  #      _gate_route_reviewer tries reports_to, then _task_resolve_coordinator, and
  #      skips any candidate equal to the filer — and absent a literal
  #      role='coordinator' row the coordinator IS the unique root, so both
  #      candidates are the filer and it falls off the end empty. Following that
  #      advice would move the root from "clearable by any agent" to "clearable by
  #      none". So the clause is now printed ONLY when the resolver returns a name.
  #
  # The approval/manual arm is scoped to `_routable=1` on purpose. A tier-2 floored
  # or human-class-declared gate is human-only BY DESIGN, and announcing that there
  # would be the wallpaper DIVE-1955 warns about. This fires only where human-only

  # is a backstop, not a silencer. Only tier 0 skips the ping.
  # DIVE-916: mint the per-gate HUMAN nonce for hard human gates (approval/
  # secret/manual — the types `task answer` enforces as human-only). Store ONLY
  # its hash; the raw nonce is handed to task_need_notify to embed in the tap
  # callback_data. It is never printed to stdout, so the agent that filed the
  # gate never sees it. decision gates are agent-clearable → no nonce.
  # DIVE-1243: `access` mints a nonce too. It only reaches this human-ping path
  # when it FELL THROUGH to a human — either the T2 category floor fired (genuine
  # human-territory) or the org named no distinct lead (the filer IS the lead, who
  # is re-escalating). Both are legitimate human clears, so it needs the same
  # tap-safe nonce as approval/secret/manual for the Telegram tap.
  #
  # DIVE-2356 (from the DIVE-2355 measurement): the mint was gated on gate TYPE
  # ALONE, and the "decision gates are agent-clearable → no nonce" line above is
  # true only at tier 0/1. A `decision` FLOORED to tier 2 is by definition NOT
  # agent-clearable — the DIVE-1117 floor refuses a non-human answer on it — yet
  # it minted nothing, so it carried no per-gate human evidence at all. Measured
  # across every answered gate on the live board: approval/manual/secret tier-2
  # were 40/40 nonce-SET, decision tier-2 was 4/47 (and those 4 came from the
  # escalate-to-human path below, the one unconditional mint). So the mint
  # condition is now "hard-human TYPE **or** tier>=2", which is what the DIVE-916
  # comment always meant by "the types `task answer` enforces as human-only".
  #
  # ORDERING, DELIBERATE — this ships ALONE. The companion rule (refuse a tier-2
  # answer whose human_nonce_hash IS NULL) must NOT land until tier-2 decision
  # gates have accumulated nonces in the wild: shipped together, it would refuse
  # the overwhelming majority of tier-2 decision answers, i.e. the dominant
  # working path. Safe to land alone on the ANSWER side, which is the side that
  # could break: the tier-2 floor in cmd_task_answer is provenance-only
  # (`(( ! human ))`), and the DIVE-916 evidence block never fires for `decision`.
  #
  # BUT THE HASH IS NOT INERT, AND AN EARLIER DRAFT OF THIS COMMENT SAID IT WAS.
  # `_proof_ledger` (cmd_proof.sh) counts a done row as an ASK when
  # `human_nonce_hash IS NOT NULL`, as an OR-arm beside the human-answered test,
  # and the published zero-human badge is `1 - asks/shipped`. Measured on the live
  # board when this landed: 704 shipped, 101 asks, of which 20 came from the nonce
  # arm ALONE — rows with no human answer at all, counted only because a nonce
  # existed. So widening the mint moves a PUBLISHED METRIC DOWNWARD, and every
  # future tier-2 decision joins that arm.
  #
  # That is intended, not incidental. A tier-2 decision IS a human ask; counting
  # it is more truthful than not, and the ledger's own header says the arm is
  # deliberately conservative so the badge understates autonomy rather than
  # flattering it. Named here because the comment above that query warns against
  # moving this metric as a SIDE EFFECT — which is a rule about surprise, not
  # about direction, and so applies to lowering it too.
  #
  # If you are here to add a nonce mint somewhere new: check what it does to the
  # ledger before you assume it is a no-op. This one was assumed to be.
  #
  # THE EMIT HALF NOW LANDS ALONGSIDE THIS (DIVE-2233 item 2). An earlier draft of
  # this comment said the nonce was "not yet reachable by a decision TAP" and
  # deferred it as a plugin-side ticket. `_task_gate_reply_markup` now appends
  # `:${nonce}` to the decision option buttons too, and the answer path verifies it
  # (see the tier-2 floor in cmd_task_answer). What made that safe rather than a
  # plugin break is graded in gate_t2_nonce_proof_unit S12b/S12e: the DEPLOYED
  # TNA_RE accepts the wider callback_data unchanged, and the fork scan reads each
  # tna.ts variant's OWN on-disk regex rather than assuming. Two forks (opencode,
  # pi) still parse the option token greedily and would swallow the nonce — they
  # are named, fenced by that arm, and tracked, not silently shipped past.
  #
  # STILL NOT DONE HERE, and this is the part that must stay undone: refuse a
  # tier-2 answer whose human_nonce_hash IS NULL. The floor is scoped to gates that
  # HAVE a nonce (S16), so every gate already in flight keeps clearing. See the
  # ORDERING note above — refuse-on-NULL waits for tier-2 decisions to accumulate
  # nonces in the wild.
  # THE MINT ITSELF HAS MOVED UP (DIVE-2054 ordering fix, above the first tasks UPDATE):
  # a tier-2 gate that cannot arm itself must refuse BEFORE any row is written, not after.

  # purpose — the DIVE-1955 wallpaper test asks whether a warning fires where nothing
  # is wrong, and here nothing is ever "not wrong": the founder is being woken every
