# cmd_memory — queryable team memory, read-path (DIVE-726 Phase 1a).
#
# `5dive memory search "<query>"` ranks and returns the most relevant snippets
# from the agent's markdown memory stores, capped at a token ceiling, with source
# provenance. BM25-first (lexical) per the Phase 1a decision (lodar 2026-07-02):
# no embedding model, no new dependency, nothing leaves the box — the moat is the
# accumulated fleet history, retrieved not injected (flat, bounded context cost).
#
# Read-only (same posture as `usage` / `digest`): scans markdown files only, no
# registry mutation, no lock, no audit.
#
# Stores (default): the calling user's own memory dirs — every
#   ~/.claude/projects/*/memory/**.md
# plus the shared wiki (community/wiki) when present on this box (internal fleet).
# Cross-agent recall (reading another agent's store) is Phase 1b — gated on the
# group-readable-store decision — so Phase 1a stays single-agent + shared wiki.
#
# Usage:
#   5dive memory search "<query>" [--limit=N] [--max-tokens=T] [--roots=a,b,...]
#     --limit       max snippets to return (default 8)
#     --max-tokens  ceiling on total snippet tokens returned (default 1500)
#     --roots       comma-separated dirs to search (overrides the defaults)

5dive memory — queryable team memory

  5dive memory search "<query>" [--limit=N] [--max-tokens=T] [--roots=a,b]
                                [--store=all|mine|wiki] [--agent=<name>]
      Rank markdown memory snippets by relevance (BM25), newest-fleet-history
      first, capped at a token ceiling, with file+heading provenance.
      --store  all (default): own stores + shared wiki · mine: own stores only
               · wiki: shared wiki only
      --agent  search ANOTHER agent's store (per-user 0600 — root only; the
               shared path for cross-agent knowledge is the wiki)
      --index  TWO-STAGE RECALL (DIVE-3821). Print one INDEX ROW per file —
               slug + the one-line description + score, no bodies — then fetch
               only what you chose with `memory get`. Measured on a real
               633-atom store, same query: 8 rows = 459 tok against 8 snippets
               = 1008 tok. --limit defaults to 25 here — the point of stage 1
               is to see enough candidates to choose between, and 25 rows
               (1401 tok) still beat 8 snippets on candidates per token.

  5dive memory get <slug> [<slug>...] [--max-tokens=T] [--roots=a,b]
                          [--store=all|mine|wiki] [--agent=<name>]
      Stage 2: print the FULL bodies of the named atoms, over the same roots
      `search` ranks. Slugs are the ones `search --index` printed (- and _ are
      interchangeable); an unknown slug names its near neighbours instead of
      just refusing. Exits 4 only when NOTHING resolved — a partial fetch is a
      fetch. Idea credit: claude-mem (Apache-2.0) search → get_observations.

  5dive memory router [--root=<dir>] [--agent=<name>] [--budget=BYTES]
                      [--recent=N] [--write]
      Rebuild MEMORY.md as a small ROUTER instead of a flat enumeration of
      every atom. A flat index grows with the store and, past the ~24 KB load
      limit, the loader drops its TAIL with no error — the oldest facts stop
      existing silently. The router carries the recall protocol, a typed topic
      map with counts, and the newest N atoms by slug; everything else stays on
      disk and is reached through `search --index` + `get`. NOTHING is deleted.
      Dry-run by default. --write backs the old index up to
      MEMORY.md.pre-router-<stamp> first. A block between
      `<!-- router:keep-start -->` / `<!-- router:keep-end -->` is carried over
      verbatim — the generator never owns your hand-written standing lines.

  5dive memory add --name=<kebab-slug> --description="<one-liner>"
                   [--type=user|feedback|project|reference] [--store=mine|wiki]
                   [--tags=a,b] [--valid-to=YYYY-MM-DD] [--supersedes=<slug>]
                   [--confidence=high|medium|low] [--provenance="<source>"]
                   [--evidence=<kind>:<ref>]... [--check='<cmd>' | --no-check="<why>"]
                   [--no-dedup] [--force]  (body on stdin)
      Compile a durable memory: writes a frontmatter markdown file into your
      own store (default) or the shared team wiki (--store=wiki, the publish
      path other agents can search — /var/lib/5dive/wiki on a normal box, the
      product repo's community/wiki on our fleet, $FIVEDIVE_WIKI_ROOT overrides), stamps provenance (who/when), appends the
      store's index line, and refuses token/key-shaped content (tripwire;
      --force does NOT bypass it). Existing file needs --force to overwrite.
      Lifecycle envelope (, all optional): --valid-to = date the fact
      expires / needs recheck; --supersedes = slug of the memory this replaces
      (that one is then demoted in recall instead of silently lingering);
      --confidence = how sure; --provenance = where the fact came from. Recall
      demotes + flags expired / superseded / low-confidence facts (never hides).
      Evidence back-refs (DIVE-3106, idea-derived from TencentDB-Agent-Memory,
      MIT): --evidence is repeatable and STRUCTURAL, so "re-verify this claim"
      is a mechanical walk instead of re-reading prose. Kinds:
        file:<path>[:line]  task:DIVE-1234  cmd:<command that proves it>
        sha:<gitsha>  url:<https://...>  run:<id>
      It sits BESIDE --provenance (free text), which is unchanged. A memory
      with no evidence is not flagged, demoted, or degraded.
      CHECKABILITY (DIVE-3885) is a SEPARATE, AUTHORED field — deliberately not
      built on --evidence. Measured 2026-09-01 over 2,651 fleet atoms: 596 carry
      evidence, but 595 of those are `run:<session id>`, stamped by the
      consolidate pipeline. TWELVE hand-authored refs exist fleet-wide. A field
      the pipeline can fill converges to whatever the pipeline fills in, so
      `check:` is one the pipeline CANNOT fill and `add` will not let it skip
      silently:
        --check='<cmd>'   a read-only shell command whose EXIT CODE re-derives
                          this fact. 0 = still true. It is run unattended by
                          `memory check`, so it is refused if it writes, escapes
                          (sudo/rm/curl|sh), or is trivially green (`true`, `:`,
                          a bare echo) — a check that cannot go red is not one.
                          It is also refused if THE SHELL CANNOT PARSE IT:
                          `--check=` reads like a description field, and a
                          sentence in it made the pass accuse a true fact
                          (DIVE-3909). A check that parses but names a command
                          absent from this box is still accepted — that is the
                          `unknown` the pass exists to report.
        --no-check="<why>" the recorded opt-out. Not free: the reason is written
                          to frontmatter as `no_check:`, so an unchecked fact is
                          COUNTABLE rather than merely absent.
      WRITE-TIME ENFORCEMENT: --type=reference (a fact about the world, the
      class that rots) requires one of the two. Every other type is unchanged.
      Write-time dedup: `add` WARNS (never refuses) when the body overlaps an
      existing memory in the same store — silence it with --no-dedup.

  5dive memory consolidate [--max-sessions=N] [--idle-min=M] [--max-chars=C]
                           [--distiller=<cmd>] [--dry-run] [--force]
      ASYNC transcript -> memory atoms (DIVE-726 phase 1). Distils your own
      FINISHED session transcripts into durable atoms (facts, preferences,
      constraints, events) written into your own store through the same
      `memory add` path — so knowledge outlives a window nobody remembered to
      compile. Built for cron, not for a live session:
        --max-sessions  transcripts per pass (default 3) — bounds the cost
        --idle-min      never touch a transcript written inside N minutes
                        (default 30). This is what keeps it off the LIVE session.
        --max-chars     excerpt cap per transcript (default 20000)
        --distiller     command reading the excerpt on stdin, returning
                        {"atoms":[...]} (default: headless `claude --print`;
                        env FIVEDIVE_MEMORY_DISTILLER also sets it)
        --dry-run       print the atoms, write nothing, leave the ledger alone
        --force         re-distil a transcript the ledger already records
      EXIT CODE IS THE ARTIFACT, NOT THE ATTEMPT (DIVE-3711): a pass whose every
      attempted distillation FAILED wrote nothing and exits 6 (auth required —
      the usual cause is a CLI that is not logged in for this user). A partial
      failure, or a pass that legitimately found nothing durable, still exits 0.
      In --json, `ok` mirrors that. Read the atom count, never the exit code, if
      what you want to know is whether anything was produced.
      Idempotent: a ledger (.consolidated.tsv beside the store) records each
      (session, byte count), and `add` refuses a slug that already exists — so a
      re-run is a no-op even if the ledger is lost.
      Writes to YOUR OWN store only. There is deliberately no --store: an
      auto-extractor must not be able to publish to the shared wiki (DIVE-481
      deny-default). Publishing stays a curated act.
      SCHEDULED FOR YOU — you do not have to wire this up. The heartbeat tick
      (the one root cron every box already has) runs ONE bounded pass per seat
      every 6h, as that seat's own user. Off: MEMORY_CONSOLIDATE=off. Retune:
      MEMORY_CONSOLIDATE_EVERY_MIN. Run it by hand any time; it is idempotent.
      COST — it spends YOUR model quota, so the number is stated, not implied.
      Measured 2026-08-20, default `claude --print` distiller, one ~300KB
      transcript at --max-chars=20000: $0.244 cold-cache, $0.081 warm, ~35s,
      ~2.5k output tokens. The scheduled cadence bounds that to <=4 calls per
      seat per day, and a seat with no NEW finished transcript costs $0 (the
      ledger short-circuits before the distiller is ever invoked). Lower it
      further with --max-chars, or point --distiller at a cheaper model.

  5dive memory check [--roots=a,b] [--store=all|mine|wiki] [--agent=<name>]
                     [--slug=<slug>]... [--timeout=SEC] [--dry-run] [--json]
      Run every atom's authored `check:` command and report which facts no
      longer re-derive. It STAMPS `check_status`, `checked_at` and `check_rc`
      into the frontmatter — that is the point of the pass, and it is what makes
      the flag two-way: a fact whose check goes green again is stamped `fresh`
      and stops being demoted. `--dry-run` looks without touching anything.
        exit 0  every check that RAN came back green
        exit 1  at least one fact went `stale` (its check ran and went red)
      A red check means THE FACT IS WRONG **OR THE CHECKER IS** — so `stale` is
      a flag for a human/agent to adjudicate, never a verdict. Recall demotes a
      stale fact and says so; it is never hidden, and NOTHING here deletes a
      memory. A checker that could not RUN (timeout, command not found, not
      executable, or shell text the parser rejects) is `unknown`, NOT stale — an instrument failure and a false fact are the same
      shape from the outside, and folding them together is how a janitor starts
      deleting true facts. Checks run read-only, with a timeout (default 20s),
      one at a time, under your own uid.

  5dive memory doctor [--roots=a,b] [--agent=<name>] [--code-root=<dir>] [--json]
      Hygiene pass over the memory store(s): index drift (MEMORY.md vs files on
      disk), dangling [[wiki-links]], stale source refs (file:line no longer in
      the codebase), near-duplicate memories, and dangling structural
      evidence back-refs (--evidence file: targets). Also runs inside the
      `memory` category of `5dive doctor` for the whole box.

Searches the agent's own ~/.claude/projects/*/memory stores (+ the shared wiki

#                         and reporting one that isn't there is the defect this

# ---- memory check (DIVE-3885) ----------------------------------------------
#
# Item 3 of the DIVE-3882 janitor plan: a `check:` whose EXIT CODE re-derives
# the fact, plus a pass that flips `check_status: stale`.
#
# THE ROW'S GUARDRAIL, kept mechanical: a red check means the fact is wrong OR
# the checker is. So this pass flips a FLAG and prints a digest. It never edits
# a body, never deletes a file, and there is no --delete to add later. Recall
# demotes a stale fact and says why; it still surfaces.
#
# And the second half of that guardrail, which is easier to get wrong: a checker
# that could not RUN is `unknown`, not `stale`. A missing binary, a box without
# the tool, a 20s timeout — those are instrument failures, and folding an
# instrument failure into "the fact is false" is exactly how an automated
# janitor starts retiring true facts.

  # Stamping is what this pass is FOR; `--dry-run` looks without touching.

# ---- memory hygiene (DIVE-991) ---------------------------------------------
#
# A runnable hygiene pass over one or more memory stores (per-agent stores +
# the shared wiki). Surfaces four classes of rot the karpathy-method stores
# accumulate as they grow:
#   - index-drift : MEMORY.md/index.md points at a file that no longer exists,
#                   OR a memory file on disk that the index never lists (a search
#                   miss — the index is what gets read into context each session).
#   - dangling-link : a [[wiki-link]] whose target slug matches no file in the
#                     store. Forward-references are legal (the memory rules bless
#                     them), so these are warnings, not errors — a nudge to write
#                     the stub or fix a typo'd slug.
#   - stale-ref : a memory citing a source path / file:line that no longer exists
#                 in the codebase (agent-main's bloated MEMORY.md is the live
#                 motivating case). Only checked when a --code-root to verify
#                 against is available, so we never cry wolf on customer boxes.
#   - near-dup : two memories in the same store with high token overlap — a
#                merge candidate (the rules say update-in-place, don't duplicate).
#
# The scan itself is a pure function of (code-root, store dirs) and lives in
# _memory_scan_json so both `5dive memory doctor` and `5dive doctor` (memory
# category) share one implementation. Python (a doctor-checked dep) does the
# parsing — bash regex over frontmatter + link graphs is a foot-gun.

# _memory_scan_json <code-root|""> <store-dir> [store-dir...]
# Emits a JSON array of {store,file,kind,severity,message} findings on stdout.
# code-root "" (or a missing dir) skips stale-ref verification.

# cmd_memory — dispatch for the `memory` subcommand tree.
# ---- async transcript → atom consolidation (DIVE-3628, DIVE-726 phase 1) ----
#
# THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR: a session window dies and everything it learned
# dies with it, because "compile before you close" is a HABIT and habits are not
# a mechanism. The motivating case is recorded in the wiki: the very discussion
# that produced this row was itself lost to an uncompiled window
# ([[tencentdb-agent-memory-vs-5dive-gap-analysis]]).
#
# SHAPE (their L0→L1→L3, ours): L0 is the raw jsonl transcript, already on disk
# and untouched. L1 is a bounded EXCERPT of it. L3 is a durable markdown atom in
# the agent's own store. The lift is idea-derived, not code-derived — no port.
#
# WHY IT IS ASYNC AND NOT A HOOK: a hook runs inside the dying session and pays
# for itself in that session's context. This pass runs from cron, out of band,
# against transcripts nobody is writing to — so the distillation cost never
# lands on a live window, and a session that dies ABRUPTLY (the actual failure)
# is still consolidated, because nothing is asked of it at death.
#
# SCOPE GUARDS HELD (DIVE-3628 body):
#   - reuses the existing stores. No database, no vector index, no CodeGraph.
#   - every write goes through _memory_add, so the secret tripwire, the dedup
#     warning, the frontmatter shape and the MEMORY.md index line are the SAME
#     ones a hand-compiled memory gets. There is no second write path to audit.
#   - deny-default sharing (DIVE-481): consolidate has NO --store flag and can
#     only ever write `mine`. Publishing to the shared wiki stays a deliberate,
#     curated act. An auto-extractor that could publish fleet-wide is the one
#     shape this must not have.
#
# The three things that make it safe to leave running unattended:
#   1. It never reads the LIVE session. A transcript touched inside --idle-min
#      is skipped. The pass itself runs in a session that is writing a
#      transcript; without this it would distill its own thinking.
#   2. It is idempotent. The ledger records (session, bytes); a re-run over an
#      unchanged transcript does no work and writes nothing. Belt and braces:
#      _memory_add refuses an existing slug without --force, so even a ledger
#      loss cannot duplicate an atom — it re-derives the same slug and conflicts.
#   3. It is bounded. --max-sessions per pass and --max-chars per transcript, so
#      the cron cost is flat whatever the store or the backlog does.
#
# THE DISTILLER IS A SEAM (--distiller). Default is a headless `claude -p`. The
# harness injects a stub, which is what makes the unit test genuinely offline
# rather than offline-looking: the module under test sends no live message, not
# merely the test file.

_MEM_CONSOLIDATE_PROMPT='You are distilling one finished agent session transcript into durable memory atoms.

Return ONLY a JSON object: {"atoms":[...]}. No prose, no code fence.

Each atom: {"type","name","description","body","confidence"}
  type        one of: reference | user | feedback | project
                reference = a durable FACT about the system or the world
                user      = a PREFERENCE or trait of the human you work for
                feedback  = a CONSTRAINT or correction on how work should be done
                project   = an EVENT or ongoing commitment not derivable from the repo
  name        kebab-case slug, <= 64 chars, specific enough to be unique
  description one line; this is what recall ranks on, so make it searchable
  body        2-6 sentences, self-contained. For feedback and project, follow the
              fact with a "**Why:**" line and a "**How to apply:**" line.
  confidence  high | medium | low

RULES
- Only DURABLE and NON-OBVIOUS facts. Nothing the repo, the git history or the
  task board already records. Nothing that only mattered inside this session.
- Absent anything durable, return {"atoms":[]}. An empty answer is a correct
  answer and is much better than filler.
- Convert relative dates ("yesterday", "last week") to absolute ones.
- Never include a token, key, password or credential value. Reference where a
  secret LIVES, never what it is.
- At most 5 atoms.'
