# DIVE-1002: an 'admin' agent can run the company, not `rm -rf` the box. Its sudo
# is scoped to a single mediated surface — the 5dive CLI (the sanctioned API for
# create/rm/provision/restart agents and box ops). Service lifecycle (start|stop|
# restart of the box's 5dive systemd units) is done THROUGH the CLI, which is
# already root under this grant, so no raw `systemctl` entry is required.
#
# DIVE-1088: the previous version also granted raw `systemctl <verb> 5dive-agent@*`
# / `5dive-*.service`. sudo-rs (visudo-rs, the DEFAULT sudo on Ubuntu 26.04) REJECTS
# wildcards INSIDE a command argument ("wildcards are not allowed in command
# arguments"), so those lines made `5dive agent create` (default admin isolation)
# fail on 26.04 with no partial install. A bare trailing `*` (any-args, e.g.
# `/usr/local/bin/5dive *`) IS accepted by sudo-rs — that's why standard isolation
# worked. Fix: drop the raw systemctl lines (redundant — the CLI runs systemctl
# internally as root via `5dive *`, and `5dive agent restart|start|stop` +
# `5dive agent _svc <verb> <5dive-unit>` cover every case the raw grant did),
# leaving only sudo-rs-valid bare-`*` forms.
#
# What is deliberately NOT granted, and why (all are one-line root escapes):
#   - `systemd-run *`    runs ANY command as root (`systemd-run --pty bash`) —
#                        a wildcard on it == NOPASSWD: ALL. Agents that need a
#                        deferred self-restart use `5dive agent restart --defer`,
#                        which runs systemd-run internally under the already-root
#                        CLI, so no raw grant is required.
#
# DIVE-2079 — say this outright, because two agents read the `systemd-run *` line
# above as a claim about the grant this function WRITES and concluded their own
# `/usr/local/bin/5dive *` was equivalent to `NOPASSWD: ALL`:
#
#   It is not, and the difference is not the wildcard. `systemd-run *` collapses
#   to full root because systemd-run's PURPOSE is to exec an arbitrary command as
#   root — any argument wildcard on such a binary hands over everything. The
#   5dive CLI is the opposite case: it is only as wide as its own subcommands,
#   and the standing invariant stated below (no 5dive subcommand may exec
#   agent-controlled input as root) is precisely what keeps `5dive *` from
#   collapsing the same way. The invariant is load-bearing, not decorative — the
#   day one subcommand execs caller input as root, `cli-root` DOES become
#   `root-all` and this grant stops being a boundary.
#
#   What this grant genuinely does NOT give is a runas target. Every line this
#   function and render_standard_sudoers write is `(root)` only, so neither an
#   admin nor a standard agent can `sudo -u claude ...` — they cannot borrow the
#   `claude` user's authenticated gh/GitHub identity. A legacy pre-DIVE-1002
#   `(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` agent can. That runas breadth, not the command
#   scoping, is the real split between the two populations that both report
#   `isolation=admin` today, which is why agent_sudo_grant reports runas
#   separately from class.
#   - `journalctl *`     pages through less by default -> `!sh` GTFOBins escape.
#                        Logs go through `5dive agent logs` (--no-pager path).
#   - `systemctl status` also pages by default -> same `!sh` escape. Service
#                        lifecycle goes through the non-paging `5dive agent _svc`.
#   - `sudo bash|su|-u <x> -i` — direct root/other-user shells.
# Granting the whole `5dive` CLI as root makes it a standing invariant that NO
# 5dive subcommand may exec agent-controlled input as root (else it becomes an
# admin->root vector). See DIVE-756/916 (sudo reduction), DIVE-950 (forge).

# DIVE-2079: read back a user's ENFORCED sudo grant and classify it — the inverse
# of the two writers above, so `agent info` can report what an agent can actually
# do rather than only the label the registry happens to store.
#
# Why this exists: `isolation` in the registry is a STORED LABEL, not a
# measurement, and nothing keeps it honest. The DIVE-1002 v1->v2 migration
# stamped isolation:"admin" on every pre-existing agent WITHOUT looking at its
# sudoers file, so an agent provisioned before least-privilege (blanket
# `(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`) reports the same `admin` as one provisioned after it
# (the CLI-scoped grant write_admin_sudoers emits). Measured 2026-07-26 on
# poke-two: agent-dev/main/olivia/marketing/community/creative are the former,
# agent-dev2/dev3/codex/don the latter, and `agent info` called all of them
# admin. Two agents reasoned about their own privilege from that label and got
# it wrong in OPPOSITE directions. A label that cannot be wrong is worth more
# than one that is convenient, so we now report the measurement beside it.
#
# Classes, in DESCENDING breadth (classify_sudo_grant reports the widest match):
#   root-all   `NOPASSWD: ALL` — any command. WIDER than today's `admin`.
#   cli-root   the whole 5dive CLI as root — exactly what `admin` means today.
#   cli-scoped only the named hidden subcommands render_standard_sudoers emits
#              (`agent _deliver|_capture|_self_restart|buzz inbound`,
#              `_audit_append`, and `_push_do` under --can-push) — what
#              `standard` means.
#   none       no sudoers entries at all — what `sandboxed` means.
#   custom     entries matching none of the above (hand-edited / drifted).
#   unknown    not measurable from where this ran (see sudo_grant_lines).
#
# Runas breadth is reported SEPARATELY because it, not the command scoping, is
# what actually separates the two `admin` populations in practice: every grant
# this CLI writes is `(root)` only, so a standard-or-modern-admin agent cannot
# `sudo -u claude ...` at all, while a legacy `(ALL)` agent can become any user
# on the box — including `claude`, whose gh credential is the human's GitHub
# identity. That is the difference an operator is really asking about.

# Emit the raw grant lines for a user on stdout; rc=1 if unmeasurable from here.
#
# Precedence is deliberate: `sudo -l` is the AUTHORITATIVE answer (it resolves
# /etc/sudoers, group entries and drop-ins together), so we prefer it and only
# fall back to reading the managed drop-in directly.
#
# SUDOERS_D overridden by the caller means "measure from these files only" —
# that is the test seam, and it also stops a root-run harness from consulting
# the live policy for a fixture user that does not exist.
#
# DIVE-2152: that contract is enforced by ONE predicate, used by BOTH escalating
# paths — the `sudo -l` below and the privileged dump. Every way of asking a
# more-powerful process to answer is gated on the dir being the real one, so an
# overridden SUDOERS_D cannot mean "these files, unless the caller can escalate
# past the permissions the fixture set". Escalation defeats a fixture's mode
# bits, so without this the same commit reads 37/0 as a cli-scoped caller and
# 30/7 as a full-sudo one — a harness grading its runner, not the code. A stub
# fixes that per harness and must be REMEMBERED; the predicate fixes the class.

# DIVE-1065/1074: scoped operational grants for a 'standard'-isolation agent.
# A standard agent has NO broad sudo, so it can't run the `sudo -u agent-X tmux`
# inject/capture that `5dive agent send`/`ask` use (those need root). This grants
# EXACTLY the hidden, single-purpose subcommands rendered below as root,
# NOPASSWD. The fleet snapshot grant is read-only and returns verdicts only.
#   * `5dive agent _deliver` (DIVE-1065) — the send/ask INJECT half.
#   * `5dive agent _capture` (DIVE-1074) — the ask reply-READ half.
#   * `5dive _audit_append`  (DIVE-1268) — append-only audit-log write (so a
#     non-root agent's mutating actions still land in the tamper-evident log;
#     re-stamps the real caller, never execs input).
#
# Why this is safe (same invariant as write_admin_sudoers above): both are
# single-purpose primitives that NEVER exec caller-controlled input (no eval /
# sh -c / printf-format), so the `*` wildcard on their args cannot become an
# agent->root vector. `_deliver` does ONLY a LITERAL tmux inject (send-keys -l --)
# of a provenance-wrapped message into a validated, registered target. `_capture`
# does ONLY a read-back of that target's pane, server-side-sliced to the caller's
# OWN reply window (lines after its marker id, up to the next marker) — it cannot
# read a peer's pre-existing pane or unbounded later activity. The worst a standard
# agent can do is inject text into a peer's pane and read the reply to its own
# question — precisely the sanctioned a2a capability this feature exists to give.
#
# Crucially this does NOT grant the whole `5dive` CLI as root — that stays
# admin-only. Only the one hardened subcommand is reachable, upholding the
# write_admin_sudoers standing invariant that no 5dive subcommand execs
# agent-controlled input as root (DIVE-756/916/950).
#
# visudo -c validated before install so a malformed entry can never lock the box
# out; on failure we remove it and fail loudly.
# render_standard_sudoers <user> <can_push> — emit (to stdout) the sudoers policy
# for a standard-isolation agent. The a2a + audit grants are UNCONDITIONAL. The
# delegated-push grant (`_push_do`) is added ONLY when can_push=1 — i.e. a BUILDER
# agent explicitly given the push capability (`agent create --can-push`), NOT
# every standard agent (DIVE-1462/STEER-4: a QA or art-director standard agent
# must not be able to ship). Exact command path with params over stdin (no arg

# DIVE-3113: normalise an openclaw model id against the provider that was
# selected on the command line. Pure (no root, no runtime) so it is unit-gradable
# — everything else on this path shells out to sudo + a real binary.
#
# An openclaw model id is `<openclaw-provider-id>/<model>`, and THE FIRST SEGMENT
# SELECTS THE PROVIDER — and therefore which auth profile is consulted. So a
# prefix that disagrees with --provider is not a cosmetic naming slip: the request
# goes to a vendor we never wrote a credential for and comes back HTTP 401 on a
# perfectly good key, with the error naming auth and hiding provider selection.
# That is DIVE-3112.
#
# Graded against the runtime's own catalog (openclaw 2026.7.1-2,
# `openclaw models list --provider <p> --plain`):
#
#     openai/gpt-5.4 · anthropic/claude-sonnet-5 · deepseek/deepseek-chat
#     openrouter/auto · openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.6
#
# Note the last one: OPENROUTER NESTS THE VENDOR ONE LEVEL DOWN. That single fact
# decides the whole function, because it means a two-segment id is ambiguous —
# `openai/gpt-5.6-luna` is a valid openclaw id (provider openai) AND a valid
# OpenRouter catalog slug (vendor openai). Only --provider disambiguates it.
#
# Three shapes reach us and each has exactly one right answer:
#   1. no slash (`gpt-5.6`)          -> prefix with the selected provider.
#   2. first segment == the provider -> already correct, pass through untouched.
#   3. a FOREIGN first segment       -> under openrouter it is an OpenRouter
#      catalog slug whose openclaw id is that slug nested under `openrouter/`
#      (the DIVE-3112 payload), so re-prefix. Under any other provider the two
#      names genuinely disagree and there is nothing to infer, so REFUSE — a
#      guess here writes a config that authenticates against the wrong vendor,
#      which is the exact failure this function exists to stop.

  # openclaw moved its per-agent auth into a sqlite store and does not read that
  # file at all — not even as a migration source. Measured on 2026-08-16 against
  # openclaw 2026.7.1-2, in a throwaway HOME, both directions:
  #
  #   * NEGATIVE: a byte-valid auth-profiles.json with the correct provider id
  #     and profile id present on disk ->
  #       Auth state store: ~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/openclaw-agent.sqlite
  #       Profiles: (none)
  #   * POSITIVE: the command below, same HOME ->
  #       Auth profile: openrouter:manual (openrouter/api_key)
  #     and openclaw-agent.sqlite appears (110592 bytes, +-wal/-shm).
  #
  # So every openclaw BYO create since that migration shipped a credential the
  # runtime never consulted: the seat reported AUTH ok (our sentinel was the
  # file we had just written) and failed at first use with ProviderAuthError.
  #
  # Do NOT "fix" this by teaching us to write sqlite. The store format is
  # openclaw's, it has now moved once, and cmd_auth.sh:488 already records that
  # an openclaw upgrade invalidates assumptions graded against the old shape.
  # Hand-writing a second private format buys the same debt again.
  #
  # The CLI also does a half a file write cannot: it REGISTERS the profile in
  # openclaw.json under `auth.profiles.<id> = {provider, mode}`. The key stays
  # in the sqlite; the registration is what makes it selectable.
  #
  # Flag placement is load-bearing: `--agent` belongs to the `models auth`
  # PARENT, not to `paste-api-key` (on the subcommand it errors with
  # `OpenClaw does not recognize option "--agent"`). `--profile-id` defaults to
  # `<provider>:manual`, which is the exact id the old jq write constructed, so

# ── DIVE-3442: push openclaw state INTO the seat, as root ───────────────────
# Everything _apply_byo_openclaw writes lands under /home/claude/.openclaw (or
# the profile dir) owned by claude. The seat was supposed to pick it up at every
# launch: 5dive-agent-start has a seed block that copies auth-profiles.json and
# agents.defaults.model into $HOME/.openclaw. On the BYO path it never fires.
#
# Measured on a live throwaway seat (openclaw + openrouter, --isolation=standard):
# the seat's auth-profiles.json DID NOT EXIST and its openclaw.json carried
# primary=null, while /home/claude's copy was correct on every field. Both arms of
# the seed's guard fail:
#   * the plain read — /home/claude/.openclaw is 0700 claude:claude, so a seat in
#     group claude cannot even TRAVERSE it (and the credential itself is 0600);
#   * the `sudo -n` fallback — a standard-isolation seat has no NOPASSWD sudo.
# The seed's own DIVE-1900 comment says creds are "normalized 0640 g=claude under
# group-traversable dirs". That is true of the PROFILE path only
# (normalize_profile_seed_perms relaxes it at bind time) and of hermes' shared dir
# (cmd_create chmods it 0775 + 0640 before enabling the unit). openclaw's DEFAULT
# no-profile dir is normalized by nobody, so the fast path can never fire for a
# BYO seat. Symptom: telegram works (the channel/gateway config is written
# straight into the seat at create time and needs no credential) and every message
# to the provider dies at auth.
#
# The tempting fix is to chmod the shared tree group-readable. REJECTED: that
# makes the operator's real provider key readable by every seat in group claude,
# which is the open question in DIVE-3305, and a bug fix must not pre-empt it.
#
# So push instead of pull. `agent create` and `agent auth set` both already run
# as root, which is the one context that can read claude's private dir AND write
# a 0600 file owned by the seat. Nothing here depends on the seat being able to
# read anything of claude's, so it is correct at every isolation level.
#
# Copies (never moves) two things:
#   1. the AUTH STORE openclaw-agent.sqlite (with its -wal/-shm siblings) ->
#      $HOME/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/, 0600, seat-owned.
#      DIVE-3489: this was auth-profiles.json. openclaw moved per-agent auth into
#      a sqlite store and does not read the JSON at all, so copying it pushed an
#      inert file into the seat and the seat still booted UNAUTHENTICATED — the
#      same defect as the write side, one hop later. Legacy auth-profiles.json is
#      still carried when present so a profile written by an older CLI is not
#      silently dropped; it is additive, and it is not what authenticates.
#   2. agents.defaults.model, models.providers AND auth.profiles, deep-merged
#      into the seat's own openclaw.json. models.providers is in the set on
#      purpose: the boot seed syncs only agents.defaults, so a provider baseUrl
#      override (zai — see OPENCLAW_PROVIDER_URL) written by _apply_byo_openclaw
#      reached the shared config and never the seat. auth.profiles joins it for
#      DIVE-3489: `models auth paste-api-key` writes the key to the sqlite and
#      the REGISTRATION (`{provider, mode}`, no key) to openclaw.json. Both
#      halves have to land or the store holds a credential nothing selects.
# Merge, not overwrite: the seat's openclaw.json already holds its channels,
# gateway mode and gateway token by the time we run.
#
# WAL safety on the sqlite copy: every writer we have is openclaw's own one-shot
# CLI, which has exited by the time either caller reaches here, so there is no
# live writer to tear a page. The -wal/-shm siblings are copied with it rather
# than assumed checkpointed — the measured post-write state had a 0-byte -wal and
# a 32K -shm, so the set is what is known good, not the .sqlite alone.
#
# Best-effort by contract (warn, never fail): the credential is on disk either
# way, and the boot seed remains as the second chance. Returns 0 always.

# DIVE-2025: can the agent actually READ its credential?
#
# The self-check used to answer this by reading `defer_auth` — a flag recording
# what the OPERATOR CHOSE, not what the agent GOT. On the completed-login path
# nothing was checked at all (not even an ok entry), so a credential that
# silently never reached the agent still printed "self-check PASS — reachable &
# autonomous". That is the DIVE-1900 shape: every status surface agrees and
# every one is wrong.
#
# THE PROBE MUST BE GROUNDED IN THE AGENT'S UID. `agent create` runs as root,
# and root reads every credential on the box, so a readability test run from
# here would pass unconditionally and prove nothing — it would replace a lie
# with a vacuous truth. Presence is answered as root (root traverses every
# 0700 dir, so its `-e` is the only trustworthy ABSENT verdict); readability is
# answered as agent-<name>. Two different questions, two different uids.
#
# ABSENT and UNREADABLE stay distinct because they take different fixes:
# absence is "go log in", unreadability is "the credential is fine, the perms
# are not" (and presents as `invalid_grant "Malformed auth code"`, which reads
# as an EXPIRED token, so the intuitive fix — a re-tap — changes nothing).

  # DIVE-1221/1222: Grok provisioning is FROZEN. Grok Build CLI (xAI) has a
  # disclosed codebase-exfiltration issue with no client-side fix as of its
  # v0.2.98 changelog; xAI shipped only a revocable server-side mitigation. As a
  # precaution we refuse grok here. Every provisioning path (agent create, hire,
  # pack import, clone) funnels through cmd_create, so this blocks all of them.
  # Unfreeze condition (olivia): a VERIFIED xAI client-side patch + a pinnable
  # version, NEVER the server-side toggle alone.
  #
  # THAT CONDITION IS HALF MET, AND WHICH HALF MATTERS. Read this before you
  # conclude anything from an armed box (DIVE-2894 source read, 2026-08-10 —
  # it corrected the 2026-08-08 reading that used to sit here):
  #   - FIRST HALF, SATISFIED: `upload_session_state` and `upload_full_prompt_txt`
  #     are genuine client-side STUBS in the current open-source Grok Build
  #     source — and have been since the first public commit (2026-07-16). So
  #     they are not a new fix and nothing about xAI's behaviour changed; the
  #     earlier "no client-side fix through v0.2.121 / 1.0.0" note was wrong.
  #   - SECOND HALF, NOT SATISFIED: `xai-org/grok-build` has ZERO tags and ZERO
  #     releases, every commit titled "Synced from monorepo". Nothing ties the
  #     source we verified to the binary a box actually installs. There is no
  #     version to pin, and no amount of further code reading closes that gap.
  #   - STILL UPLOADING on the paths that remain: prompt images, turn results,
  #     session metadata, and a working-directory `memory.tar.gz`.
  #
  # DIVE-2894/2910/3185: the owner (lodar — 2026-08-07 18:07Z for the internal
  # host, again 2026-08-10 19:17Z for managed customer boxes) answered "arm"
  # anyway, with the residual above in front of him. That is a recorded owner
  # RISK ACCEPTANCE ON A PARTIALLY-SATISFIED CONDITION. It is not a fix, not a
  # pinnable version, and not a withdrawal of the condition — an armed box is a
  # box where the owner accepted a live, unpatched exfiltration risk.
  #
  # So: never read an armed box as evidence of a patch, and never arm one on
  # your own authority. A marker written by 5dive provisioning is the sanctioned
  # case and is what that acceptance covers; a marker you placed by hand to get
  # past this guard is not, and is the thing the sentence below has always meant.
  # The warn below fires on every armed create and is meant to stay noisy.
  #
  # DIVE-3185 — WHAT ARMS IT CHANGED, AND WHY IT IS A FILE AND NOT AN ENV VAR.
  # lodar (2026-08-10 19:17Z) accepted the risk for CUSTOMER boxes too, not just
  # the one internal host of DIVE-2910. The scope grew; the mechanism therefore
  # had to change, twice, and both reversals are worth knowing:
  #   1. NOT an env var swept over SSH to every box (DIVE-3092 forbade it and
  #      DIVE-3185 briefly re-prescribed it). "Revocable" requires knowing WHICH
  #      boxes carry it and reversing them reliably. A line in /etc/environment
  #      on someone else's machine gives you no inventory, no diff, and no
  #      rollback that is not a second sweep. A release gives you all three.
  #   2. NOT a bare bundle-versioned relaxation either. 5dive-ai/5dive is public
  #      and boxes install the newest TAG, so a guard that simply went permissive
  #      would unfreeze grok for every OSS installer — implementing something
  #      broader than the decision it claims to implement, and handing an
  #      unpatched exfiltration path to people who never saw our risk acceptance.
  # Hence: the guard stays in the bundle (reviewable in a diff, versioned,
  # revocable by a release) and PERMITS only where a managed-fleet marker written
  # by OUR provisioning is present. Auditability comes from the release; scope
  # comes from the predicate. Default is still REFUSE, and the OSS path is the
  # unmarked path, so nothing about a stranger's install changes.
  #
  # THE MARKER IS A SPEED BUMP, NOT A SECURITY BOUNDARY. Say it here because
  # this is where someone would otherwise assume the opposite and build
  # something load-bearing on it. `agent create` is root-gated, so anyone who
  # can create the marker could already have deleted this guard from a public
  # repo — the marker grants no capability that did not already exist. What it
  # buys is DELIBERATENESS: a knowing opt-in by someone who read the source is a
  # categorically different act from a permissive default that reaches everyone
  # who ran an installer. It does not enforce scope against a determined user
  # and must never be described as if it does.
  #
  # UN-ARMING (the reverse must exist or this is a one-way door — DIVE-3185
  # acceptance 4): remove the marker; the guard keys on PRESENCE, so `=0` or an
  # empty file does nothing. Revert the provisioning template BEFORE sweeping
  # existing boxes, or boxes built in between come up armed. Verify per box with
  # the zero-cost DIVE-2910 probe (`agent create <n> --type=grok --channels=bogus`
  # must reach the channels error, not this refusal) through the control plane.
  # And the load-bearing caveat: un-arming stops the NEXT create and nothing
  # else. This gate is on CREATE, not on RUN — grok agents already provisioned
  # keep running. "Revocable" does not mean "recallable".
  # Full reverse:
  # community/wiki/un-arming-the-grok-unfreeze-what-the-env-var-can-and-cannot-reverse.md
  #
  # FIVE_GROK_ARM_MARKER overrides the path. It is a test seam (it is what lets
