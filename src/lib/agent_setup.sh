# exchange — A's outbound question and B's outbound reply — therefore show up
# under the correct sender's identity. The previous receiver-side hooks
# (userprompt-mirror-inter-agent.sh for the inbound, stop-mirror-inter-agent.sh
# for the reply) are retired no-ops, kept on disk only so existing agents'
# settings.json don't error on a missing command. New-agent settings.json
# below no longer wires either of them.
