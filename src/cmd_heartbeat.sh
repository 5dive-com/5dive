# -------- 5dive heartbeat — wake agents that have queued work --------
#
# A per-agent "heartbeat": a single host cron runs `5dive heartbeat tick`
# every few minutes. For each enrolled agent the tick asks one question —
# "does this agent have a todo task on the shared board?" — and acts:
#
#   * no todo            -> do nothing. The agent never wakes, so it burns
#                           zero tokens and never starts its 5h usage window.
#   * already in_progress -> skip. The agent is still chewing on its last
#                           task; piling on a second nudge would interleave work.
#   * has todo + due      -> ensure the agent is running, optionally /clear it
#                           for a fresh context, then inject ONE nudge telling
#                           it to do a single task and then idle — and CLAIM
#                           that task (status=in_progress + started_at) in the
#                           same breath. DIVE-2244: the claim is the dispatcher's
#                           job, not the agent's. Until it was, the "already
#                           in_progress" arm above and the entire recovery layer
#                           (reaper / orphan reclaim / unwedge / stall detector)
#                           read a field nothing ever wrote — see _hb_claim_task.
#
# "One task per tick" is the whole point: 1 nudge = 1 task. The next tick (no
# sooner than the agent's `everyMin`) picks up the next one. The agent process
# stays running between ticks (cheap tmux session) — `fresh` sends `/clear`
# before the nudge so each task starts from a clean conversation without the
# cold-start cost of a full restart.
#
# Config lives per-agent in the registry under .agents[<name>].heartbeat:
#   { enabled: bool, everyMin: int, fresh: bool, lastRunAt: <epoch> }
# lastRunAt throttles *wakes* (not checks): a no-work agent is re-checked every
# tick (a cheap sqlite count) but only counts against everyMin when it actually
# wakes. So everyMin is "minimum minutes between real wakes", honoured even
# though the cron fires more often.

_HB_DEFAULT_EVERY=30
# Deterministic hard cap for the /goal loop. A task left in_progress longer than
# everyMin * _HB_STALE_MULT minutes is force-closed by the tick (see the reaper
# in cmd_heartbeat_tick): /goal clear to stop any runaway loop, then auto-cancel.
# This is the real backstop — /goal's own "stop after N turns" is model-judged
# and was observed to overrun (see _hb_wake). Min floor keeps short everyMin sane.
_HB_STALE_MULT=3
_HB_STALE_MIN_MINUTES=45
# Starvation signal: a task nudged this many times without ever reaching 'done'
# is almost certainly being starved — e.g. the codex/grok listen-loop watchdog
# yanking the agent off the task right after the nudge. Per-task nudge counts
# live in the registry under .agents[<name>].heartbeat.nudges and are pruned once
# a task leaves todo.
#
# DIVE-2244 changed the MECHANISM this detects, not the conclusion. Before, the
# dispatcher never claimed, so a starved task simply sat in 'todo' and got
# re-nudged every cadence; this counter was the only thing that noticed. Now the
# dispatcher claims at the nudge, so reaching this count means the task was
# claimed and then RECLAIMED back to todo (rule a/b/c) that many times. Either
# way: nudges are not converting into finished work, and re-nudging forever
# without saying so is the failure. Note the counter still works only because
# the claim is stamped AFTER _hb_mark_run — see the call site.
_HB_STARVE_AFTER=3

# DIVE-3218 — nudge-threshold ENFORCEMENT, the rung above _HB_STARVE_AFTER.
#
# _hb_mark_run has echoed a per-task nudge count since DIVE-1486 "so the caller
# can decide whether the task is being starved". Until now the only caller that
# read it LOGGED (the WARN under _HB_STARVE_AFTER, at the call site) and changed
# nothing. Measured 2026-08-11: dev3 was woken about ONE urgent row, DIVE-2896,
# 173 times over 3.5 days with zero state change — every wake a full fresh-context
# opus session that re-read the same stale in-row note, re-derived the same "wait"
# conclusion and exited, with no memory that it had done so 172 times already.
# A counter nobody consumes is detection, not enforcement:
#   community/wiki/a-nudge-counter-nobody-consumes-is-detection-not-enforcement.md
#
# _HB_STARVE_AFTER STAYS AS IT IS. It is a cheap, early, per-tick observation at
# n>=3 feeding the `starved` tally in the tick summary; this ladder is a separate,
# far higher bar that ACTS. Lowering the log threshold to meet the action, or
# raising it to hide it, would silently redefine an emitted signal — the readers
# of `starved` are the tick summary line and its JSON, both in this file, and
# neither is touched here.
#
# THRESHOLDS ARE PER PRIORITY BAND: the cost of a wasted wake is identical across
# bands but the tolerable latency is not — an urgent row must cross in HOURS, a
# low one may take a day. They count NUDGES, not hours, because the count is the
# burn: a row nudged 8 times has cost 8 whole sessions whatever the wall clock
# says. At the common 15-minute cadence these are roughly 2h / 4h / 8h / 16h to
# the first rung, and double that to the second.

# hardcode (DIVE-3218) because the right N is fleet-shaped — it moves with tick
# cadence and roster size — and must be tunable without a release cut.
#
# A MISSING OR GARBLED CONFIG FALLS BACK TO THE DEFAULT, NEVER TO "OFF". An

# this ladder exists to end, so there is deliberately no value that disables it

                                          # opt-in reactive wake mode + wake-budget + auto-sleep.
                                          # no args after <name> => show current mode/budget/sleep/cost.

  <dur>: minutes (e.g. 30), or 45m / 2h / 1h30m.
  wake-mode ( Phase 1): 'cold' opts an agent into reactive
        wake-on-alert with a wakes/day budget cap (default ${_HB_WAKE_DEFAULT_CAP}) so a chatty
        trigger can't thrash it; cost-per-wake is surfaced (display only, zero
        billing). A cold agent that goes idle with no open work is auto-slept
        (systemctl stop) after --sleep-after minutes (default ${_HB_SLEEP_AFTER_MIN}m) and is
        woken again by the next trigger. 'always_on' (default) is unchanged;
        main + marketing are pinned always-on and refuse 'cold'.
  fresh (default off,): --fresh sends /clear before each task so
        context starts clean, at the cost of a full CLAUDE.md/project re-prime
        on every wake (up to ~48x/day on the default 30m cadence). Off keeps
        the running conversation across tasks — cheaper, and what main/
        marketing already ran manually before this became the default.

Wire the driver into cron (root), e.g. every 5 minutes:
  */5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/5dive heartbeat tick >> /var/log/5dive-heartbeat.log 2>&1

Add --json to any subcommand for machine output.

# --- DIVE-3501: the all-held seat, made observable off the log -----------------
#
# THE FAILURE THIS SURFACES. The tier guard holding a row is CORRECT (DIVE-1065).
# What was wrong is that a seat whose ENTIRE runnable queue is held has no
# observable difference from a healthy idle seat: the rows read `todo`, the unit
# reads `active`, quota is fine, and the only trace is a `_hb_log` line on stderr
# that lands in /var/log/5dive-heartbeat.log — 7865 of them by 2026-08-16, read by
# nobody. dev2 sat with 5 runnable high rows, all held, every 5 minutes for six
# days while every liveness signal said it was fine.
#
# WHY THIS PREDICATE IS STATELESS, and why that is the point. It threads NO
# consecutive-tick counter through the tick. It is a pure query over `tasks` +
# the registry: a seat with >= 1 runnable todo, where EVERY one would be held
# (rank(created_by) < rank(assignee), both MEASURED, creator != assignee), and
# whose last wake is >= --stalled-hours old. So it is exactly reproducible from
# the DB at any later time, it survives a heartbeat restart, and each clause is
# independently mutation-gradable — break the rank comparison, or weaken the
# "every" quantifier to "any", and the test goes red on each separately. A tick
# counter would be gradable only by simulating ticks.
#
# RUNNABLE means what the PICKER means by it, so this is `_hb_pick_tasks` at a
# wide limit rather than a second hand-written todo query — a re-implementation
# would drift from the dep-aware ordering the guard actually sees.
#
# BREACH-ONLY (DIVE-3460): silent when no seat is stranded. A monitor that prints
# a reassuring line every day is a monitor nobody reads
# (community/wiki/a-monitor-with-no-reader-is-not-a-monitor.md).

# DIVE-3218 — consume the nudge count. Called once per delivered nudge, straight
# after _hb_mark_run, with the post-increment count.
#
# TWO RUNGS, deliberately mirroring the DIVE-2853 recurring-stall ladder rather
# than inventing a second shape: surface-then-change-hands, once per row each,
# stamped in the ROW so the throttle survives a registry prune. What differs is
# only what the two ladders can read — 2853 keys on HOURS since materialisation
# for a beat whose later slots are being eaten by skip-if-open; this one keys on
# COUNT of fruitless wakes for any standard row, and the two predicates cannot
# see each other's rows.
#
#   RUNG 1, at N: escalate once (existing `task escalate` semantics — one
#   priority band, capped at urgent, pings the owner) and write a dated line into
#   the body. Escalation alone is a weak lever on a row that is already urgent —
#   that is precisely why the body note is not optional.
#
#   RUNG 2, at 2N: change hands, or park with a wake date. Reassign to a FREE
#   agent (never the current assignee — handing the row back to the party whose
#   not-starting-it IS the fault is the no-op this rung exists to stop — and
#   never the row's own verifier, the DIVE-3097 guard, since that manufactures
#   the assignee==verifier shape by heartbeat). Lane first: a free agent under
#   the same org parent, then any free agent. If nobody is free, PARK with a wake
#   date so the row stops being nudged until then.
#
# NEVER CANCEL, and this is where the ladder parts company with DIVE-2853's
# fallback. That one cancels because an open recurring instance SUPPRESSES every
# later slot of its beat, so leaving it open is an ongoing outage. A standard row
# suppresses nothing; it is merely starved. A starved row is not an unwanted row,
# and auto-cancelling one would destroy work lodar asked for on the evidence that
# nobody got to it.
# DIVE-3218 (main, 2026-08-11) — the SIBLING of the unanswered-gate hold.
#
# `_hb_nudge_enforce` reads the priority band, the row's own stamps and the gate
# hold. It reads NOTHING about the assignee's SEAT — so a seat working a
# deliberate multi-row order accumulates nudges on rows 2..N BY CONSTRUCTION,
# precisely because it is productively working row 1. At the `high` default of 8
# those rows get reassigned out from under a seat doing exactly what it was told.
# Measured, not hypothetical: two such notices fired on quinn's DIVE-3229 and
# DIVE-3238 on the morning of 2026-08-11, both actively planned in an order main
# had given them.
#
#   "A row waiting on an unanswered human gate is not starved — the wait is on a
#    person." Its sibling: a row waiting behind its own assignee's OTHER work is
#   not starved either — the wait is on a QUEUE.
#
# NO NEW SIGNAL. The question is answerable from rows this function already
# reaches: did this seat advance ANYTHING between rung 1 firing and now? Two
# independent readings, OR'd, because each covers the other's blind spot.
#
# THE TRAP THAT MAKES THE NAIVE VERSION USELESS: the engine's own writes are
# attributed to the SEAT, so "any row of this assignee changed" is true even for
# a seat that is completely dead.
#   * rung 1 stamps `updated_at` on THIS row, and on every OTHER row of the same
#     seat it fires on -> exclude $tid, and exclude rows carrying an engine
#     nudge stamp inside the same window.
#   * lifecycle_events rows written when the DISPATCHER claims a row carry
#     `authority='dispatcher'` and the SEAT'S OWN NAME as `actor` (measured:
#     olivia/dev/ops/quinn all appear this way). That is the engine claiming on
#     the seat's behalf, NOT seat work -> excluded, together with 'heartbeat'.
#     Measured on the live board 2026-08-11: zero seat events carry
#     authority='heartbeat', so that exclusion costs nothing real.
#
# FAILS TOWARD HOLD, DELIBERATELY. An unreadable store, a missing column or a
# missing lifecycle_events table yields "" from `db`, which reads as "no evidence
# of advance" -> the ladder still fires. So the TASKS reading is primary (its
# columns are the ones this function already selects) and the ledger reading only
# WIDENS the hold; a store without lifecycle_events degrades to the tasks reading
# rather than to a hold that silently never holds.

# line ("Upgrade your plan", or "wait for … limit to reset" / "resets at|in").
# Case-insensitive and tolerant of CC copy drift across the monthly-spend and

# arm of _hb_wall_class, and before this row those two carried near-identical
# copies of it that had to be widened together or the seat classified
# `undetermined` while the matcher above said `wall`. Covers the pre-4206 forms
# (`resets at 4pm`, `resets in 20 minutes`) and the bare clock Claude Code
# actually prints today (`resets 4am`, `resets 11:30am`), plus `continuing

# responses:
#
#   rate limit (rolling 5h / 7d window)  RETRYABLE. The window rolls back on its
#       own, so press-continue / restart-and-retry is the correct answer and is
#       what DIVE-1666/DIVE-1677 built.
#   spend cap (monthly / weekly ceiling, credit balance)  NOT retryable until a
#       human raises the ceiling or billing resets. Every dispatch into it is a
#       whole session that cannot produce work: ~20 of 50 analysed sessions
#       produced nothing, DIVE-3384 was re-attempted across 15+ sessions and
#       still read `todo`, and the answer to the wall was ~30-40 `continue`s.
#
# _hb_wall_class is PURE — no tmux, no registry, no clock — so the discrimination
# that the whole fix hangs off is unit-testable on transcript text.
#
# THREE outcomes, not two. A pane that IS a wall but matches neither
# discriminator returns `undetermined` and says so. Folding "I could not tell"
# into either verdict is the class this repo keeps re-learning
# (tests/lib/grading_tree.sh, DIVE-2274, DIVE-3450's clamp) — and here it would
# fold specifically toward "retry", which is the defect itself.
#
# ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: the monthly-spend dialog ALSO offers "Stop and wait for
# limit to reset", so if the reset-time arm were tested first every hard cap
# would read as retryable. The HEADER is the discriminator, not the action line.

#       a gated row todo. The latter repeatedly requeued DIVE-3994 after its gate
#       was filed, so its maker still has nothing actionable until the person answers.
#   (c) Within a priority tier, PREFER the critical path: the todo whose downstream
#       dependent chain is longest, so the longest remaining chain starts soonest.
# The recursive CTE walks task_deps forward (blocked_by -> task_id, i.e. toward
# dependents) and is depth-capped at 64 so a pathological/cyclic graph can't spin.

# DIVE-2244 — THE DISPATCHER CLAIMS. Stamp status='in_progress' + started_at at
# the moment the heartbeat nudges an agent against a specific task.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The whole stuck-work recovery layer keys on this one field:
# the deterministic hard cap, the runaway reaper, orphan reclaim, unwedge, and
# the busy-guard in the tick all read status='in_progress' / started_at. The
# only writer was an INSTRUCTION — the /goal nudge text says "claim it with
# 5dive task start DIVE-N" — and an instruction an agent must remember at the
# moment of action is not a control (DIVE-2146). The dispatcher is the
# mechanism; the instruction is a hope.
#
# WHAT THE BOARD ACTUALLY SHOWS, re-measured at implementation time rather than
# inherited from the ticket. Compliance is PARTIAL and erratic, not zero:
# of tasks closed per day, the share that ever had started_at set ran 23% (14 of
# 61, 2026-07-28), 51% (35 of 68, 07-27), 60% (50 of 83, 07-26). The filing
# ticket reported 0 of 24 and "0 tasks with started_at in 48h"; its six NAMED
# tasks are genuinely NULL, but the aggregate does not hold — 48 rows were
# claimed in that same window. So `in_progress == 0` is a TRANSIENT, not the
# permanent condition the ticket diagnosed.
#
# That correction moves which half of this fix does which job, so state it
# plainly rather than let the ticket's ordering stand:
#   * the false-positive ALARM is only partly a claim problem. in_progress was
#     genuinely 0 at 08:15Z on 2026-07-28 — a real quiet moment, not a dead
#     field. Claiming raises the floor (an agent under nudge now holds a row)
#     but does not by itself make the predicate sound; the probe-conclusiveness
#     half of DIVE-2244, in _hb_stall_sweep, is what addresses the reported
#     firing.
#   * the SILENT half is the one this function fixes outright, and it is the
#     costly one. At 23-60% coverage, most in-flight work was invisible to
#     every recovery rule above: a genuinely runaway or orphaned task in that
#     majority had no recovery path at all and would present as a
#     permanently-todo row nobody notices. Claiming at the nudge takes coverage
#     of dispatcher-driven work to 100% by construction.
#
# The heartbeat already knows the exact task it woke the agent for, so the claim
# belongs here.
#
# KNOWN PROPERTY, not an accident of where the UPDATE landed: THIS CLAIMS ON
# DELIVERY, NOT ON ACCEPTANCE. _hb_wake succeeding means the nudge was SENT into
# the pane. It does not mean the agent read it, understood it, or began. So a
# nudge that lands in a wedged pane produces a row that reads "someone is on
# this" while nobody is — the board asserts work-in-progress from a send. There
# is no acceptance signal available at this layer to claim on instead (the agent
# reading its own nudge is unobservable from here), so delivery is the honest
# ceiling of what the dispatcher can know, and it is stated rather than implied.
#
# What keeps that from becoming a silent permanent stall is that the recovery
# net behind it does NOT depend on the same unreliable liveness read. Of the
# three reclaim rules in _hb_reclaim, rule (c) — the hard cap at
# everyMin*_HB_STALE_MULT — is UNCONDITIONAL: pure arithmetic on age_min, no
# _hb_agent_idle call, and its `/goal clear` is best-effort (`|| true`) so a dead
# pane cannot gate the requeue. Only rule (b) consults the idle probe. So if the
# probe is wrong in the busy direction (a hung process that still reads alive),
# rule (b) misses and the worst case is a BOUNDED stall to the budget, then a
# requeue; a second overrun blocks + escalates to a human rather than churning.
# A wrong probe cannot produce a task that is neither re-nudged nor reclaimed.
# tests/heartbeat_dispatcher_claim_unit.sh fences this directly rather than
# leaving it to a reading of the code.
#
# NARROW BY CONSTRUCTION — this must not become a way for a tick to rewrite rows:
#   * called ONLY inside the _hb_wake success branch, so a tick that wakes nobody
#     (not due / busy / no work / spread-deferred / wake failed) mutates nothing;
#   * WHERE status='todo' AND kind='standard' — never stomps a row something else
#     already moved between the wake and this stamp, and never touches a
#     recurring TEMPLATE (starting one silently retires it, DIVE-2055/2059);
#   * started_at=COALESCE(started_at, ...) — same idempotence as `task start`, so
#     an agent that DOES run `task start` afterwards is a no-op, not a re-clock.
#
# Returns nonzero when the claim did not land, so the caller can say so out loud

# DIVE-3251 — WHAT THIS CLEARS AND WHAT IT MUST NOT.
# The started_at=NULL is DELIBERATE and stays: this function's whole job is to
# hand the row back as a clean slate, and the age math below
# (COALESCE(started_at, created_at)) plus the per-task nudge counter both key off
# it. What was WRONG was that started_at was also the only board-visible evidence
# that work had ever happened, so every reclaim silently converted "worked on for
# 90 minutes" into "never started" — 58 rows fleet-wide, 16 of them still open,
# and main could only defend a working seat by going and reading git.
# `first_started_at` now carries that evidence and IS NOT IN THIS UPDATE. Do not
# add it: the reset field and the evidence field are separate on purpose, and
# putting them back together re-opens this defect.
#
# The reclaim also EMITS ITS OWN LEDGER EVENT. It could not be counted before:
# the task.started emit above deliberately uses a constant per-task idem_key, so
# a UNIQUE collision silently drops every re-claim and the ledger records the
# FIRST claim only. That is the right trade there (a nudge loop must not be able
# to write unbounded rows) but it left reclaim cycles invisible to any reader —
# and `task start` writes no audit row either, so separating "the start never
# wrote" from "it wrote and something cleared it" took a second store and a lot
# of luck. This event carries a per-reclaim idem_key (kind|id|epoch) so cycles
# ARE countable, and its detail records the started_at value being erased, which
# is the fact the row itself is about to stop carrying.
#
# DIVE-4104 — TWO MODES, ONE ERASURE SITE. The fourth argument selects what
# happens to the HANDOFF; the claim reset (status todo, started_at cleared,
# first_started_at preserved because this is the only writer that clears it) is
# identical in both and stays in exactly one statement, which is what the
# structural arm in tests/task_first_started_at_unit.sh exists to hold.
#
#   clean         (default) — the row goes back as buildable work. Unchanged.
#   keep-handoff  — the row goes back into the VERIFIER's queue: assignee is
#                   re-asserted to the row's verifier and the delivery stamps
#                   are left alone, so `task show` still prints
#                   `handoff: delivered (awaiting verifier ACK)`. Guarded on
#                   verifier set and the delivery being live and ungraded, so

# DIVE-4104 — THE RECLAIM LOOP. Measured over the 7 days to 2026-09-08: the
# heartbeat reclaimed quinn's claimed rows 88 times across 40 distinct rows
# (51 `idle`, 31 `session gone`, 6 real 45m overruns), and 17 deliveries that
# week carry "re-delivery of the same pass, not rework" — a grade that was in
# flight got destroyed and the row went round again. Three of those four
# buckets are not neglect at all:
#
#   * `idle` on a WALLED seat. quinn's account was quota-walled 840 min on
#     09-07 and 540 min on 09-08. A seat sitting on "⚠ Usage limit reached" is
#     byte-identical to an abandoned one through `_hb_agent_idle`, which reads
#     a pane, not a reason. So the wall did not PAUSE the grade, it DESTROYED
#     it — and the supervisor already knows better: it classifies exactly that
#     pane `quota-exhausted` (supervisor_events), which is the fact the
#     reclaimer never asked for.
#   * `session gone` on a row that is ALREADY DELIVERED. DIVE-2560 exempted a
#     delivered, unacked verifier-held row from the idle-stall and hard-cap
#     arms and deliberately left rule (a) firing, on the reasoning that a truly
#     gone session should re-present the row fresh. That is right about the
#     NUDGE and wrong about the DELIVERY: the reclaim hands the row back as a
#     clean slate, and a clean slate is what lets it be picked up as buildable
#     work again. The maker has nothing to do — the pass is delivered — so the
#     re-delivery round is pure churn, and each one wakes a fresh maker session
#     that reloads a PR it had already closed out.
#   * `session gone` on a seat whose WORKSPACE for the row survived. A restart
#     that leaves the branch it pushed sitting in a local checkout has not lost
#     the work; re-presenting the row from a clean slate throws away the claim
#     and the run for nothing.
#
# The 45m budget arm (6 of 88) is left exactly as it was: those are real
# overruns and requeueing them is correct.

# DIVE-4104 — how long a quota-walled seat's claim is held rather than
# reclaimed. Echoes the epoch until which `name`'s claims are PARKED, or empty
# when the seat is not currently walled.
#
# The authority is the supervisor's LATEST observation for the agent, not a
# scan for any wall ever seen: a seat that was walled at 09:00 and healthy at
# 09:10 is not walled, and the reclaimer must act on the current reading. Only
# `quota-exhausted` parks; every other classification (including `stalled`,
# which is what an idle-stranded seat reads as) falls through to the ordinary
# rules, so this can never park a genuinely abandoned claim.
#
# THE CAP IS NOT OPTIONAL AND IT IS NOT INFINITE. A park with no deadline is a
# wedge: the seat never transitions, the claim is never reclaimed, and the row
# is invisible to every other rule in this file. The wall itself sometimes
# names its resume time (`quotaDeadline` in the observation's signals) and
# sometimes does not — the supervisor writes the literal string `unknown` when
# the refusal names no parseable deadline. When it IS parseable the park runs
# to that deadline plus one tick, so the seat gets a whole tick after the wall
# lifts to resume on its own before anything is taken off it. When it is not,
# the park runs 6h from the observation — long enough to cover the 840-minute
# and 540-minute walls measured on this account only in the parseable case, and
# deliberately SHORTER than those in the unknown case: an unparseable wall is

# DIVE-4104 — does the workspace this row was being worked in still exist?

# The only branch binding the board records mechanically is the one a push
# wrote to `ship_events`, so that is what this asks about: the latest branch
# pushed for this task, resolved in the local checkouts. A branch still sitting
# in a local checkout means the restarted seat can pick the work up where it
# left off; nothing was lost, so nothing needs re-presenting from scratch.
#
# UNKNOWN IS NOT INTACT. No push, no branch, an unreadable checkout root — all
# return 1, and rule (a) then reclaims exactly as it did before. This function
# may only ever SUPPRESS a reclaim on positive evidence; a probe that cannot
# see is never allowed to hold a claim (the failure it would cause — a wedged
# claim nothing can take back — is worse than the churn it would prevent).
#
# A REF IS NOT A WORKSPACE (DIVE-4104 iteration 2). The first cut asked
# `git rev-parse --verify refs/heads/<branch>` per checkout. `refs/heads` is
# per-CLONE, not per-worktree: the ~700 checkouts under this root share a
# handful of `.git` directories, so that question resolves to "somebody once
# pushed this branch from this host" — true for nearly every branch ever — and
# it answered INTACT for branches checked out in zero worktrees. Since rule (a)
# reacts with a bare `continue`, the row then skipped (b) and (c) too: a dead
# session would have held such a row forever, with no counter and no ledger
# event. So the probe asks the per-worktree question instead: does a LIVE
# worktree of this clone have that branch checked out right now?
# `git worktree list --porcelain` is the only reader that knows, and a listed
# worktree whose DIRECTORY is gone is not a workspace — git still carries the
# admin record of a deleted checkout (that is what it calls `prunable`) until
# somebody prunes it, and this host never does.
#
# IT IS BOUNDED, and the bound is measured rather than defensive: this host's
# projects root holds ~700 checkouts (one worktree per ticket, never swept), and
# an unbounded scan forks `git` once per checkout INSIDE the heartbeat tick. So
# it probes at most _HB_WORKSPACE_SCAN_MAX of them and then gives up, and giving
# up returns 1 — i.e. it reclaims exactly as before. Hitting the cap is the same
# "no positive evidence" answer as an absent branch, which is why a cap is safe
# here and would not be in a rule that acted on the negative. The cap costs less
# than it used to: checkouts are DEDUPED BY SHARED CLONE, and one
# `worktree list` per clone sees every worktree of it — including the ones that
# live outside this root, which the old per-directory scan could never reach.

#   (b) idle stall         -> todo. Same process still running, but the task has
#       sat in_progress past _HB_STALL_MIN_MINUTES AND the agent is idle now:
#       it claimed the task then walked away. Gated on a confident idle reading
#       so we never reclaim work that's actively in flight.
#   (c) hard cap           -> requeue, then escalate on repeat. in_progress past
#       everyMin*_HB_STALE_MULT (floored): the runaway backstop. /goal clear to
#       stop any loop, then reclaim to todo — NEVER cancel, since that silently
#       loses real mid-flight work (DIVE-482/200). A task that keeps overrunning
#       even after a clean requeue is genuinely stuck: on the
#       _HB_REAP_ESCALATE_AFTER'th reap, block it + escalate (ping owner & human)
#       so it's visible, not churning — still never auto-cancelled. DIVE-4111:
#       that escalation fires ONCE per (row, owner), latched on
#       reap_escalated_at, and the pause CLEARS started_at like every other
#       reclaim does; later reaps of the same row requeue it silently.
#
# (a)/(b)/(c) all reclaim the work (it still needs doing); (c) additionally
# escalates a repeat offender. Nothing is ever cancelled here. Echoes
# "<reclaimed> <escalated>". Uses started_at (falls back to created_at).
#
# DIVE-2560: (b) and (c) both read claim age as evidence of stall, but a row
# the CURRENT holder is verifying — delivered by its maker, assignee flipped to
# the verifier, handoff_ack_at still NULL — is not stalled at all: the maker's
# job is done and the age on the claim is verifier think-time, not neglect.
# Before this fix that state was indistinguishable from ordinary abandoned
# work, so a verifier who claimed a delivery and sat with it (reading, or just
# between heartbeat ticks) got it yanked back to todo and re-nudged on a loop —
# the exact "claimed then went idle" churn _hb_stall_sweep already has a
# correct, slower-cadence nag for. Rows in that state now skip (b) and (c)

    # first: the dispatch tick's busy-guard (see _hb_dispatch, "busy — N
    # in_progress, skip") counts EVERY in_progress row for the seat and returns
    # one level ABOVE the picker. So a standing claim on a row nobody here owes
    # does not merely cost the re-pick it was meant to save -- it makes the seat
    # undispatchable onto ANY row until some other seat merges, which is this

    # also breaks the boundedness invariant tests/heartbeat_reclaim_loop_unit.sh
    # exists to defend (a hold whose exit is not this seat's act re-fires

    #
    # Letting it reclaim costs nothing that the skip was buying: the board

# DIVE-2063 / DIVE-2111: the maker→verifier terminal-state clause appended to the
# /goal nudge. Emits ONE sentence (leading space) when the woken agent stands on a
# live verifier loop — the MAKER variant before the handoff, the VERIFIER variant
# after it — empty otherwise. Never fails the wake: any DB trouble yields "".
#
# WHY EACH HALF EXISTS. The /goal condition accepts exactly three terminal states
# (done, cancelled, human gate). A loop rail has THREE roles and each has a correct,
# complete action that reaches NONE of them:
#   - maker: `task done` DELIVERS (status stays todo, assignee moves to the
#     verifier). Fixed by DIVE-2063.
#   - verifier AFTER the handoff: `task reject` returns a FAIL verdict (status back
#     to todo, assignee back to the maker). DIVE-2063 declined this half on the
#     premise that "for the verifier, the terminal close really is theirs" — false:
#     accept is only ONE of the verifier's two terminal actions, and the other one
#     wedges the session the same way (measured on DIVE-2090). A terminal-state
#     clause has to enumerate TERMINAL ACTIONS, not the happy-path close.
#   - verifier-of-record BEFORE any handoff (maker_agent EMPTY): the row was routed
#     here for a DECISION, not to be built or graded. Its complete action is to make
#     the call and ROUTE THE ROW ON — `task assign`. DIVE-2111's comment called this
#     agent "just an ordinary owner" and gave it nothing, which is right about
#     `reject` (genuinely refused with no maker) and wrong about the role: an
#     ordinary owner is not a null role, it is the third one. Measured six times,
#     last on DIVE-2745 where it wedged olivia's session across ~8 stop attempts.
#     Fixed by DIVE-2834.
#
# WHY THE CLAUSE TELLS THE AGENT TO RE-READ (DIVE-2834, the sharper half). This
# generator runs ONCE, at wake, and its output is frozen into the goal text — but
# `maker_agent` is a LIVE COLUMN, and the tick cannot re-mint the clause mid-session
# because its own busy-guard skips an agent whose task is already in_progress (see
# the header of this file). So a role-derived instruction is cached against a role
# that is not stable for the life of the instruction: on DIVE-2745 the row began
# with no maker, was reassigned out, was built and delivered BACK, and at that point
# the verifier variant's predicate was satisfied — about the same row and the same
# agent, with no event in between other than the rail working as designed. The only
# variant that can be overtaken this way is the third one (the other two are already
# at the end of their role's life), so IT, and only it, also names the role it can
# turn into and points at `task show` as the authority at the moment of acting.
# Re-evaluation still happens — moved from generator-time to act-time, and done by
# the reader against the source of truth rather than by a snapshot that cannot know.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT A FAIL-OPEN. The obvious wrong version of this ("a todo task with
# something in its result field counts as done") would let a maker satisfy the goal
# by writing a result and walking away — worse than the wedge it fixes. So:
#   1. It is keyed on the LOOP SPEC, not on status text: a `verifier` must exist,
#      and whether it equals the woken agent is what SELECTS the variant — it is
#      never inferred from prose.
#   2. The agent must currently OWN the task (assignee = the woken agent), i.e. be
#      the maker about to deliver or the verifier holding the handoff — never a
#      bystander.
#   3. Maker variant: the state it names is the `handoff: delivered (awaiting
#      verifier ACK)` line, which `task show` prints ONLY when maker_agent is set
#      AND assignee=verifier AND the task is still open — i.e. only after
#      `_task_route_to_verifier` has actually recorded the handoff. Nothing the
#      agent can write by hand produces that line; only a real `task done` on a
#      real loop does. maker_agent is stamped from the pre-route assignee, so it
#      equals the woken agent by construction — a state the maker can genuinely
#      reach.
#   4. Verifier variant: gated on maker_agent being set, i.e. the SAME predicate
#      `task show` uses to print the handoff line — so it never names `task
#      reject`, which `cmd_task_reject` refuses unless a maker exists.
#   5. Routing variant: the mirror image — gated on maker_agent being EMPTY, so it
#      and (4) are mutually exclusive by construction and neither can fire on the
#      other's state. The state it names is `assignee = <someone else>`, which the
#      agent cannot reach while still holding the row: satisfying it means actually
#      DIVESTING the task, not writing a field. It is not a "punt anywhere" either
#      — it names ONE default destination, `created_by`, the agent that filed the
#      row and is asking for the answer, and it requires the decision to be
#      recorded on the row BEFORE the routing (a routed row with no reason is the
#      DIVE-2683 empty-cancel defect one verb over).
#
#      AND IT ASSERTS NO ROLE IT CANNOT DERIVE (olivia, iteration 1 reject). The
#      first cut of this variant stated "this row was routed to you for a DECISION,
#      not to build and not to grade" as flat fact. The predicate does not select
#      that: `verifier == assignee && maker_agent EMPTY` is ALSO the shape of a row
#      that is simply the owner's to do. Measured on the live board, 12 closed rows
#      have ever been in this shape and 6 are in the guard's firing set; of those 6,
#      DIVE-2456, DIVE-1956 and DIVE-1789 were owners doing or grading their own
#      work, and in each the correct terminal was the `done` the first cut warned
#      against and never offered. Those rows got silence before the change and would
#      have got a confident wrong premise after it — the worse direction, and this

# all cheap sqlite scans, run once per tick in root context:
#   (1) WAKE — a parked task whose wake_at passed unparks back to todo, so the
#       wake loop below can hand it to its agent THIS tick.
#   (2) T1 TTL — a tier-1 gate unanswered for 48h gets its recommendation
#       applied. Provenance is 'auto:ttl' + uid 0 and the closure IS signed
#       (root context) so gate-proof verify explains it rather than flagging a
#       raw-sqlite forgery. Deliberately NEVER: HUMAN-CLASS gates
#       (_gate_human_class — DIVE-2235; this used to exclude only 'secret', so
#       a tier-1 APPROVAL/MANUAL/ACCESS self-applied its own recommendation
#       after 48h with no human: tier was downgrading class), loop gate steps

#       gates predate the column; never auto-apply on a fuzzy clock — they're
#       tier NULL = treated as tier 2 regardless).
#   (3) T2 REMINDER — tier-2 (or legacy NULL-tier, or rec-less tier-1) gates
#       stale for 72h batch into ONE message per filing agent's channel,
#       manual asks grouped as a "15 minutes" block. gate_pinged_at throttles

# DIVE-1490: receipt-backed gate re-nags. A freshly filed gate gets one follow-
# up after 1h; once a follow-up has been delivered, subsequent reminders are
# 24h apart. Migration-free: gate_pinged_at is both the delivery receipt and
# throttle stamp. An initial receipt is identifiable because it is before
# need_asked_at+1h; a re-nag receipt is at/after that boundary. Failed sends are
# deliberately NOT stamped, so the next heartbeat retries instead of silently
# dropping the gate. T2 uses the filing agent's paired-human channel; T1 routes
# through the existing org-lead resolver. One message/keyboard is built per
# resolved recipient, regardless of how many gates are due.
# DIVE-3474 arm 2 — THE GRACE. Arm 2 stops the FILE-TIME ping, and without this
# conjunct the interrupt simply moves fifteen minutes downstream: this sweep would
# fire the first re-nag over the agent rail before the reviewer has had a natural
# wake to find the gate in its queue. So a routed, NON-URGENT gate gets a grace
# window in which only the natural wake may deliver it. `--urgent` (gate_urgent=1)
# skips the grace entirely and re-nags on the old 15-minute clock, and every
# escalation rung past the grace is UNCHANGED — including the fall-through to the
# paired human, which is what keeps a queued gate from becoming a lost one.
# Deliberately keyed on `routed_reviewer`: an unrouted gate is the HUMAN's, its
# holder has no wake this queue is visible at, and nothing here may quiet it.
_HB_GATE_RENAG_GRACE_HOURS="${FIVEDIVE_GATE_RENAG_ROUTED_GRACE_HOURS:-2}"
# DIVE-3674 — THE GRACE IS CONDITIONED ON THE WAKE IT DEFERS TO. Everything above
# is right about a BUSY reviewer and says nothing about an idle one: the queue
# count that carries a routed gate rides on `_hb_wake`, and `_hb_wake` is only
# reached for a seat that has a row to be woken AGAINST (:4600, `no todo — stay
# idle`). A reviewer with nothing runnable therefore has no next natural wake, the
# premise fails, and the grace stops being a deferral and becomes two hours of
# plain silence — longest in wall-clock terms exactly when the whole fleet is
# idle, which is the case where no other seat could have taken the gate either.
# Measured instance (DIVE-3670/3667): a gate routed to dev2 at ~00:30Z sat
# unanswered across 19 consecutive `[dev2] no todo — stay idle` ticks. dev2 was
# CORRECTLY idle by every liveness signal; nothing was broken, the bet simply had
# no wake to pay out on.
#
# So the escape is NARROW BY MEASUREMENT, not by taste. Of 294 routed tier-1
# non-urgent gates in the 30 days to 2026-08-22, 279 were answered INSIDE the 2h
# window and 252 of those within FIFTEEN MINUTES: on a fleet with work, the
# natural wake arrives promptly and the grace costs nothing. Shortening it
# generally would reinstate the interrupt DIVE-3474 removed for the 95% case to
# fix the 5%. This conjunct fires ONLY where the wake provably is not coming.
# (The counting query is in DIVE-3674's body; the 30d window slides, so re-deriving
# it later moves these by ones, not by orders. `gate_delivery_log` — the source the
# row asked for — does not exist; `tasks` + `gate_history` are what carry it.)
#
# And the grace was not what delivered the measured instance either. `gate_history`
# for DIVE-3667: the gate filed 00:23:12 sat 104 minutes and was WITHDRAWN unanswered
# at 02:07:53; the re-file at 02:07:55 was answered at 02:08:15 — and the audit trail
# names the carrier, an out-of-band `agent _deliver` from the filer at 02:07:59
# (`path=file-time`, 805 bytes). Not `--urgent` (the row is gate_urgent=0), not this
# sweep, and not the seat's next natural wake, which did not arrive until 02:10:06.
# A person noticing was the mechanism. That is the thing this conjunct replaces.
#
#   provably: the reviewer is a known agent (`agents_org`) with NO runnable todo
#             and NO in_progress row. The todo half mirrors `_hb_pick_tasks`
#             exactly — same `kind='standard'`, same open-blocker NOT EXISTS — so
#             "runnable" here means what the picker means by it and cannot drift
#             from it silently. A todo behind an OPEN blocker is skipped by the
#             picker, so it is not a wake.
#             The in_progress carve-out is a NO-CLOBBER rule, not a claim that a
#             mid-turn seat will meet the gate: it may finish its turn with an
#             empty queue and go straight to `no todo — stay idle`. The residual
#             is BOUNDED and it is stated rather than hidden — the conjunct is
#             re-evaluated every sweep, so the tick after that row leaves
#             in_progress the seat reads as wakeless and the gate goes out. What
#             the carve-out buys is that we never type into a live turn; what it
#             costs is one turn's worth of delay, against the 2h it removes.
#   tier < 2: the carrier this un-quiets is `_hb_gate_renag_agent_rail`, the
#             in-band agent rail. A tier-2 gate re-nags a PAIRED HUMAN, whose
#             attention was never a function of the seat's queue, so the premise
#             this conjunct repairs was never load-bearing there. Widening the
#             human lane is a different change and this is not it.
#
# The failure direction stays loud: if the rail cannot reach the seat the sweep
# hands the row straight to the paired human, unchanged.

# DIVE-2587 — the AGENT RAIL for lead-routed re-nags.
#
# MEASURED, not inferred (prod board + /var/log/5dive-heartbeat.log, 2026-08-03):
# every engineering approval that reached the human that day on the T1 lane was
# ALREADY correctly routed. One row isolates it — a push-for-review approval
# filed 09:20:21 with routed_reviewer=olivia, gate_pinged_at 09:40:02, and the
# heartbeat log carries the matching `[gate-renag] delivered <row> via olivia`
# line for that exact second. The ping came from THIS sweep, not from filing:
# the file-time routed rail (_task_need_route_deliver) never touches Telegram at
# all, it hands off over `5dive agent send`, and every gate it filed that day
# still has gate_pinged_at NULL. Routing was never the defect.
#
# WHY MORE ROUTING CANNOT FIX IT: `_task_agent_channel olivia` resolves olivia's
# PAIRED channel, and on this host every paired agent is paired to the SAME human
# chat. "Send it to the lead" and "send it to the human" are the same Bot API
# call with a different bot token. Routing decides who may CLEAR a gate; it has
# never decided whose phone rings. This sweep predates the lead-route rail and
# has no agent branch at all, so it converts a correctly routed gate back into a
# human ping — with tap buttons, which is why the human then answers it and the
# record reads `human:olivia` on a row nobody mis-routed.
#
# So an AGENT reviewer's re-nag goes over the agent rail, the same rail the
# file-time handoff already uses. It falls back to the paired-human channel when
# that rail cannot deliver, and the caller keeps the human channel for gates past
# _HB_GATE_AGENT_RAIL_HOURS. That backstop is what makes this a QUIETING change
# and not a SILENCING one: a lead-routed gate nobody clears still reaches a
# person, just not inside the first day.
#
# Synchronous by choice, unlike the file-time rail's detached poll: the org-parent
# escalation a few lines up already calls `cmd_send` synchronously in this same
# sweep, there are at most a handful of reviewers per tick, and an rc we can
# branch on is the whole basis of the fallback. An unobserved send here would
# reproduce DIVE-2011 on a fresh rail.

  # T2/legacy hard-human gates. DIVE-3742: ONE SENDER, not one per filer.
  #
  # This loop used to partition by the FILING agent and push each partition down
  # that agent's own bot, on the reasoning that different bots cannot be collapsed
  # into one Telegram request. True, and it answers the wrong question: the
  # cardinality that matters is not requests-per-bot, it is MESSAGES THE HUMAN
  # RECEIVES. The recipient is the same person either way, so partitioning by
  # filer buys him nothing and costs him one notification per filing agent —
  # measured 2026-08-26 with 8 open tier-2 gates, 5 filed by main and 2 by
  # olivia, which is exactly the two DMs lodar reported ("I have automated Gate
  # reminder - unanswered gates (paired human) from you and Olivia. maybe keep
  # only one.").
  #
  # Which bot is the RIGHT one is already answered elsewhere in the product: the
  # resolved org coordinator is the seat that fronts the pinned needs-you banner
  # (DIVE-1568/333), so the re-nag now rides the same bot the banner does and the
  # human has one gate surface instead of N.
  #
  # Channel ownership is not lost by this: _hb_gate_renag_batch still partitions
  # per HUMAN owner (DIVE-3342) before rendering, and every row keeps its own
  # /task_<id> link and answer button, so a collapsed batch is the same rows in
  # one message rather than fewer rows.
  #
  # FAIL OPEN, NEVER QUIET. An unresolvable coordinator ('' — no agent tagged
  # coordinator and more than one org root) is precisely the state that killed the
  # needs-you banner fleet-wide in DIVE-2031, and a gate re-nag is a worse thing to
  # lose than a pin. So an empty or unpaired coordinator falls straight back to the

# DIVE-1140: gate-shipped flag sweep. A human gate (approval/decision/manual)

# (DIVE-217/1138) surfaces 'ghost' gates on already-shipped work. This sweep, per
# tick, scans each configured repo's origin/main for a commit referencing an OPEN
# gate's ident; on a hit it FLAGS the gate (stamp shipped_flag_at + ping the
# owner "likely shipped, verify+close"). Flag-only for ALL tiers (lodar
# 2026-07-12): a merge is not a human sign-off (DIVE-555) and a commit may only
# partially fix a gate, so it NEVER auto-answers/closes — a human still clears it.
# shipped_flag_at throttles to one flag per gate. Same isolation contract as the

# loop. Factored git lookup (_hb_repo_grep_ident) so the unit test can stub it.

# DIVE-1416: fleet-stall self-heal, gaps #2 and #3 (gap #1 is _hb_blocked_sweep
# above; DIVE-1415 extended it to every terminal close, not just done/cancel).
# DOGFOOD INCIDENT 2026-07-17: the fleet sat ~100% idle ~3h while actionable
# v0.10 work was stranded, and NOTHING self-corrected or alarmed — supervisor
# read "15 healthy / 0 stuck" because "idle while work sits open" wasn't a
# signal it modeled. Three isolated, independently-throttled passes, same
# `|| _hb_log` isolation contract as every other tick sweep:
#
#  (a) GAP#2 — surface a stale maker->verifier delivery. `_task_route_to_verifier`
#      re-queues the task as the verifier's own todo, which the verifier's
#      heartbeat wake normally picks up — but when that doesn't happen (verifier
#      not enrolled, its everyMin hasn't elapsed yet, wake skipped, wrong
#      channel…) the delivered work sits invisible with no independent signal.
#      Flag once per delivery (handoff_stale_pinged_at, reset on every fresh
#      handoff by _task_route_to_verifier) once it's sat past
#      _HB_VERIFY_STALE_MIN unacknowledged — ping BOTH the verifier (so they can
#      act) and main (so a human-visible trail exists even if the verifier is
#      itself unreachable).
#
#  (b) GAP#3 core — fleet-idle-while-actionable-work-is-open alarm. Zero agents
#      in_progress AND zero running loops (fleet-wide "nobody is doing
#      anything") while >=1 todo task sits assigned to someone, or >=1
#      fleet-actionable human gate sits open, is EXACTLY the incident: dead air
#      that reads as healthy. A gate only counts here if it's tier<=1 (an agent
#      can clear it — genuinely stranded) or never surfaced to the human at all
#      — a PINGED tier-2 gate awaiting the human overnight is legitimately
#      idle, not stranded, and must not re-alarm every cycle (that's the
#      idle-night alert-fatigue class this design already killed once).
#      Tracks how long the condition has persisted in task_prefs
#      (stall_first_seen_at) and only alarms once it's held for
#      _HB_STALL_MIN_MINUTES (the "K min" in the design) — a single idle tick
#      between tasks is normal, not a stall. Re-alarms every
#      _HB_STALL_MIN_MINUTES while it persists (never silent), clears its
#      tracking the moment the fleet is busy again or the backlog clears.
#
#  (c) GAP#3 canary — pinger liveness. DIVE-1434: the gate-ping TTL reminder
#      batch (the T2 pass in _hb_gate_ttl_sweep above) silently stopped writing
#      gate_pinged_at fleet-wide and nothing noticed for days. This check is
#      DELIBERATELY independent of that pass's own code path — a canary that
#      shares the suspect logic can go dark with it. It recomputes, from
#      scratch, whether any gate is eligible for a ping right now (same
#      staleness shape the reminder pass uses, given 30m grace past the 72h
#      mark so a brand-new eligibility isn't a false trip) and compares against
#      the fleet-wide MAX(gate_pinged_at). Eligible gates existing while no ping
#      has landed in over an hour means the batch looks dead — alarm main,
#      throttled to avoid re-alarming every tick while it stays broken.
# DIVE-2122 — READ THE ARTIFACT, NOT A PROXY FOR IT.
#
# The gap#3 alarm below asserts "nothing is self-correcting" on the strength of
# tasks.status='in_progress' == 0. That is a PROXY for "an agent is doing work", and
# it is wrong in exactly the productive case. Measured 2026-07-26 20:06, when the
# alarm fired while the fleet was working: 257 agent commands in the preceding ten
# minutes (dev 112, main 42, olivia 38, marketing 25, codex 20, community 10,
# creative 10), dev running `gh pr` seconds before the alert, 12 tasks closed in 3h,
# all 10 units active. dev's last `task start` was SEVEN AND A HALF HOURS earlier.
# Agents do substantial work without ever holding a row in in_progress: builders work
# in worktrees against a branch, a delivered maker->verifier task sits at status=todo
# assigned to the VERIFIER, and verification / wiki compiles / review / inter-agent
# exchange never touch task status at all. So in_progress==0 means "nobody used the
# task verb recently", which is not the claim the alert makes.
# This is the fifth recorded instance of the same false positive (2026-07-19, 07-21,
# 07-22 x2, 07-26); the takeaway was written down after the third and never built.
#
# WHY THIS PROBE AND NOT THE OBVIOUS ONES — both alternatives were measured and both
# would have SILENCED the detector, which is far worse than the false positive it
# fixes (a noisy alarm is visible; a dead one is not):
#   * session-transcript mtime — the heartbeat NUDGES agents during a genuine stall,
#     and a nudge appends to the transcript. Freshness would be manufactured by the
#     very condition we are trying to detect.
#   * raw command count from the sudo journal — ~90% of it is automated polling. In a
#     20-minute sample: 140 `5dive task coordinator`, 20 `task inbox`, 20 `agent
#     info`, 22 `tmux has-session`, 18 `capture-pane`, 20 codex version probes. A
#     dead fleet still emits all of it, so any threshold over raw volume reads busy
#     forever. Excluding the pollers needs a hand-maintained allowlist that nobody
#     owns and that rots toward "everything looks busy" — the DIVE-2118 shape, a rule
#     whose performance half has no owner.
# `_hb_agent_idle` is the existing, already-maintained read of the actual artifact:
# the agent session itself (native runtime state where available, pane-stability plus
# a per-runtime composer marker otherwise). Reusing it means this probe cannot drift
# away from the fleet's own notion of busy.
#
# COST is paid only when the alarm would otherwise fire (rare, and throttled to once
# per _HB_STALL_MIN_MINUTES): a pane probe samples twice _HB_IDLE_SAMPLE_SEC apart.
# It early-exits on the first ACTIVE agent, so the common false-positive path is one
# probe, not eleven.
#
# Sets _HB_ACT_{CHECKED,ACTIVE,IDLE,BLOCKED,UNKNOWN} and _HB_ACT_{ACTIVE,BLOCKED}_NAMES.
# UNKNOWN is a THIRD state and is never folded into idle: an uncapturable pane did
# not prove the agent idle, and an alert that cannot tell "measured idle" from "could
# not measure" is asserting something it never measured.

  # up. The two stall shapes are disjoint and a query for one cannot see the other.
  #
  # WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN ONE LATE TASK: the materializer is skip-if-open, so
  # while an instance sits open the template's NEXT slot is suppressed. One
  # unworked instance therefore does not delay a beat, it DELETES every subsequent
  # occurrence of it for as long as it sits. Measured twice on DIVE-1237: DIVE-2026
  # ate 07-27..07-28, DIVE-2403 ate 07-31..08-04 (five slots, nothing shipped).
  #
  # WHY IT STAYED INVISIBLE BOTH TIMES: the downstream producer's own precondition
  # check absorbs the stall correctly — it declines to activate, so nothing errors
  # and the only symptom is a green-looking no-op a day or two later. A fault whose
  # recovery is clean is a fault nobody reports.
  #
  # NOT KEYED TO ANY IDENT. DIVE-1237 is only where we noticed it; the defect is a

  # (a3) DIVE-2853 — the SECOND RUNG, on a row (a2) already surfaced and that is
  # still todo-and-never-started a full window later.
  #
  # WHY A LOUDER OR REPEATED NOTICE CANNOT BE THIS RUNG. (a2)'s single notice is
  # addressed to the row's assignee — i.e. to the one party whose not picking the
  # row up IS the observed fault. Measured on DIVE-2694: flagged on time
  # (recurring_stall_pinged_at 2026-08-05 04:00:08, exactly once, correctly), then
  # sat unstarted another 28h. The cause was NOT a missed message. dev had the
  # message, replied to it, and was mid-delivery on DIVE-2801 under a single-task
  # goal — STRUCTURALLY BARRED from starting a second row. A fence outlives every
  # re-ping, so volume at that same addressee is a guaranteed no-op and the row
  # stays dark for as long as the other goal runs.
  #
  # SO THIS RUNG CHANGES HANDS INSTEAD OF RAISING VOLUME:
  #   1. reassign to an agent the board can see is FREE (_hb_free_agents), the
  #      template's creator first when they are free — that is who owns the beat's
  #      inputs and who unstuck it by hand both previous times;
  #   2. if nobody is free, CANCEL with a written reason so the template re-fires.
  #
  # WHY CANCEL IS THE FALLBACK AND NOT A 'blocked' PARK, which is the posture used
  # for a reaped in_progress row a few hundred lines up: skip-if-open counts EVERY
  # instance with status NOT IN ('done','cancelled'), so 'blocked' would keep
  # suppressing later slots — it renames the outage instead of ending it. Cancel is
  # also the documented manual unstick (main did exactly this on the DIVE-2237 sweep
  # and on DIVE-2403), and it never runs with an empty result: the reason is written
  # into the row, and the old assignee is told in the same breath, so a cancel here
  # is never indistinguishable from the beat having never fired.
  #
  # ONCE PER INSTANCE (recurring_stall_escalated_at), so a reassignment cannot
  # thrash a row around a fleet — and if the NEW hands do not start it either, the
  # next window's rung is the cancel, which is what actually restores the beat.

  # (a4) DIVE-2207 — gap#2's SECOND predicate: a delivery whose blocking gate has
  # since been ANSWERED.
  #
  # WHY (a) ABOVE CANNOT SEE THIS, which is the whole reason it needs its own
  # predicate rather than a widened one. (a) carries `handoff_ack_at IS NULL`, and
  # DIVE-2196 correctly excludes gate-blocked rows from it. But the ack has more
  # than one writer: any verifier who ran `task start` and THEN hit the blocker has
  # already stamped it. So the moment the human answers and the wait comes back to
  # the verifier, (a) is permanently blind to that row — not throttled, structurally
  # excluded. Measured on the live board 2026-07-28: the clean population (gate
  # answered at or after handoff_delivered_at) is 20 rows; 17 were graded inside the
  # hour, 2 took 1-6h, one took over 24h. It bites rarely and silently, which is the
  # case for a rail and not against one.
  #
  # WHY NOT CLEAR/REFRESH handoff_ack_at INSTEAD (shape (a) of DIVE-2206, rejected):
  # un-stamping erases a record of something that DID happen — the verifier reviewed
  # and escalated. DIVE-2196 existed because the record lied by omission; clearing
  # makes it lie in the other direction, and on a row whose ack was earned by a
  # genuine `task start` it re-arms (a)'s "still unacknowledged" message against a
  # verifier who demonstrably acknowledged. That false nudge IS the DIVE-2196 defect.
  #
  # THE MESSAGE IS DIFFERENT ON PURPOSE. (a) says "still unacknowledged", which is
  # false here — the verifier acted. Per
  # community/wiki/on-a-maker-verifier-task-the-ack-is-the-close.md a nudge that
  # names a verb authors an instruction, so this one may only exist POST-answer:
  # while the gate is open, "close it" is a disguised policy answer on a question
  # the human has not decided. After the answer it is safe, and it is the point.
  #
  # THROTTLE: its own column. handoff_stale_pinged_at is already burned on 30 rows
  # fleet-wide including the live specimen this was written for (DIVE-2146) —
  # reusing it ships the fix dead on arrival for exactly its target population.
  #
  # `parked_at IS NULL` is one clause BEYOND the DIVE-2207 spec (olivia's constraint
  # 2), added deliberately and mirroring the (a2) rail directly above: a parked row
  # was set aside on purpose and nudging it is noise. Measured when added: 22 parked
  # rows live fleet-wide, 0 of them inside this window.
  #
  # WHERE THE SAFETY COMES FROM, AND IT IS NOT IN THIS PREDICATE (olivia, DIVE-2207
  # ruling). The clause is only ever a DEFERRAL rather than a permanent exclusion
  # because `cmd_task_park` MANDATES --wake and refuses without it (E_USAGE,
  # DIVE-1357: "a park with no revisit date is the block graveyard"), so every
  # parked row carries its own clock back. That is a structural guarantee, not a
  # property of today's board — the 22/0 measurement above says this moves no count
  # TODAY, which is a different and much weaker claim.
  # SAFE ONLY WHILE THAT MANDATE HOLDS. A new park path that does not require a
  # wake, or a direct `parked_at` write via sqlite, bypasses it and silently
  # converts this deferral into a permanent exclusion — and nothing in THIS file
  # would say so. The bypass is not hypothetical: an unaudited direct UPDATE on the

  # (a6) DIVE-3483 — A ROW STRANDED ON A **BUSY** SEAT.
  #
  # The gap this closes, measured on the live board 2026-08-16: idle-stranded was
  # detected 4187 times in 7 days across 11 agents and acted on ZERO times, while
  # (b) below — the only arm that actually sends — has fired ONCE in the board's
  # history (task_prefs.stall_alerted_at = 2026-08-12). Detection without a
  # consumer on one side, an alarm that cannot fire on the other.
  #
  # WHY NEITHER EXISTING RAIL SEES IT. Both take IDLENESS as a precondition, and
  # the real shape is a LIVE seat holding a row it never chooses:
  #   * cmd_supervisor.sh's `stalled` needs THAT SEAT to have no active work, so a
  #     seat working its own charter classifies healthy and its stranded row is
  #     invisible; and it is observe-only by design ("recorded, NEVER acted on").
  #   * (b) needs the WHOLE FLEET idle (in_prog==0 AND running_loops==0). With 132
  #     open rows that is essentially never true, so a row that is not moving stays
  #     silent because OTHER agents are busy — which says nothing about this row.
  # Both live instances were LANE problems, not priority problems: DIVE-3339 (the
  # only defect between lodar and a two-way buzz conversation) sat 4 days
  # never-started on a lane at its WIP cap, and DIVE-3330 (a close path that walks
  # past the merge gate) sat 3 days dropped on a seat that was demonstrably alive.
  # lodar found both by reading the board; no rail did.
  #
  # DELIBERATELY NOT A RECOVERY ACTION. This surfaces and names the lane; it never
  # reassigns. Hands-changing is the (a3) ladder's job and it is scoped to recurring
  # instances on purpose — auto-moving arbitrary work is a P2 action and this rail,
  # like the supervisor, stays observe-and-report.
  #
  # THROTTLE IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. Naive surfacing here emits those 4187 pings, gets
  # muted, and recreates the silent-monitoring defect DIVE-3460 exists to remove. So
  # it is one ping per ROW (stranded_pinged_at, the shipped_flag_at pattern), never

# ── DIVE-3343: the per-TASK token budget is NOT enforced, and cannot be ───────
#
# `_hb_task_budget_sweep` lived here from DIVE-2794 to DIVE-3343 and is gone.
# Its enforcement is removed, not relocated, not softened. This block is the
# decision record, because the field it read (`task_budget`) is still stored,
# validated and displayed, and the next reader WILL be tempted to wire a
# consequence back to it.
#
# WHY IT IS GONE, and it is not "the number was badly chosen". The number could
# not be MEASURED. `_spend_scan_task_ids` keys its window by ASSIGNEE and sums
# every transcript under that agent's home inside [started_at, done_at or now].
# Nothing in the scan filters by task, because THERE IS NO PER-TASK TOKEN SIGNAL
# IN A TRANSCRIPT TO FILTER ON. So the charge was "everything this agent spent
# on anything while the row happened to be open":
#
#   * it grew with the row's WALL-CLOCK AGE and was independent of any work done
#     on it — an idle row parked for existing;
#   * the sweep was called once per task id, so two rows open on one agent were
#     EACH billed that agent's full spend. The double-billing was structural.
#
# DIVE-3341 removed the built-in 5M default, which removed the POPULATION the
# bad measurement was applied to (an unbudgeted row is never evaluated). It did
# not fix the arithmetic, and a row with an EXPLICIT budget was still graded by
# it. This row finishes that: no row is graded by it, because the grade was
# never about the row.
#
# WHAT WAS REJECTED, written down because it is the attractive wrong answer:
# splitting an agent's spend across its open rows. That INVENTS attribution
# rather than measuring it, and an invented number with a park wired to it is
# the same failure wearing a better disguise. Renaming the guard to what it
# actually measured (per-agent spend since the row opened) was also rejected:
# the honest name does not make the consequence proportionate — that figure
# still cannot justify halting a row's live work.
#
# WHAT IS LOST, stated plainly rather than left for a future incident to find:
# the two rows that motivated DIVE-2794 (DIVE-2814, 27% of one fleet day;
# DIVE-3045, 19.1M in 24h on a LOW row blocked on a credential) are once again
# seen by NO hard control. The per-AGENT cost guard (rolling 24h, whole seat)
# and the per-LOOP ceiling (loop-scoped) both still hold and both still measure
# something real, but neither is row-scoped. Restoring a row-scoped control
# requires emitting a real per-task token signal FIRST and reinstating a budget
# on top of it — a project on its own merits, not a bugfix.
#
# WHAT STAYS, and why it is not dead weight: `--task-budget=`, `task set-budget`
# and `task_budget_default` still accept and store a value, and both surfaces
# now SAY that it is advisory. Removing the flags would break callers' scripts
# for no safety gain; leaving them silent would let an operator believe they had
# a guard they do not have.
#
# `_spend_scan_task_ids` (src/cmd_loop.sh) is NOT removed — the per-LOOP ceiling
# still uses it, and there the claim is different: a loop's child tasks are the
# work that loop dispatched, inside that loop's own window. That is a weaker
# claim than per-task attribution, not the same one.
#
# tests/task_budget_enforce_unit.sh is the guard on this decision: it asserts
# the sweep is absent, that an explicit budget is never even SCANNED, and that
# two rows on one agent are not double-billed — each with a control that RUNS
# the removed comparison, so restoring enforcement goes red instead of quietly
# re-arming every box.

# DIVE-1019: run the per-agent token-budget engine once per tick. Idempotent —
# alerts/hard-stops are deduped inside cmd_usage_budget_check, which also
# refreshes the state cache that `watch` reads. Capture stdout so its summary
# never leaks into the tick's own output; mirror it into the heartbeat log.

# DIVE-1434 transport-liveness canary. A claude-type agent delivers gate-ping tap
# buttons via its OWN getUpdates poller (task_need_notify curls the button, but the
# TAP that clears the gate arrives as a callback_query the agent's poller must
# consume). The poller bumps its bot.heartbeat beacon every ~3s (DIVE-818); if it
# dies — e.g. a restart left the single getUpdates slot unacquired — buttons still
# SEND but taps never land, so a gate silently can't be cleared from the phone. The
# original incident hid because gate_pinged_at (the stale-reminder batch) is the
# WRONG signal; this watches the RIGHT one. dev2's DIVE-1416 gap#3c canary watches
# the stale-reminder batch — complementary, different code path.

    #
    # What DIVE-2384 got right and keeps: scope it to the ONE named seat and

    #
    # What is RETIRED: "do NOT blanket-restart: a restart deletes the beacon and
    # re-arms this alarm". True of the BEACON (shutdown() unlinks it), false of
    # the POLLER, and the two were conflated into standing advice that turned
    # the only working remedy into a prohibition. Measured 2026-08-26 on two
    # seats (DIVE-3748): launcher=0/server=0 before, 1/1 nine seconds after
    # `5dive agent restart`. Recency-of-restart correlates with the broken state
    # because the failure happens AT channel start — the correlate points at the
    # moment of the defect, not at its cause.
    #
    # And the CONFIRM step changes with it: the beacon collapses three
    # distinguishable states into one string (never started / dependency failure
    # / genuinely dead), so bot.pid + bot.heartbeat cannot tell a human which
    # one they have. The process table can — but ONLY if the pattern names both
    # entry points. DIVE-3752 put a recording launcher in front of the poller,
    # so a seat on 5dive-plugins >= that release runs `bun start.ts` and a seat
    # on an older cache (and every telegram-<x> variant) still runs
    # `bun server.ts`; a remedy pinned to one of them reads ZERO on half the
    # fleet and tells the human to restart a seat that is fine. `bun
    # (start|server)\.ts` is the clean count — the launcher's own argv is

    #     an external filer. This is the majority of the board. Falling through
    #     is not a failure mode, it is DIVE-1065's intent. Holding here would
    #     stall every human-filed task fleet-wide, which is the cost the ticket
    #     was (correctly) afraid of.

    #     or the agent IS registered and its isolation is missing/malformed. We
    #     have no basis to rank either side, so ranking them 0 asserts something
    #     we do not know. HOLD.
