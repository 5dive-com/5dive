# -------- 5dive supervisor — fleet health brain (DIVE-724, P1: observe-only) --------
#
# The unifying layer ON TOP of heartbeat/rotation/auto-resume/loops (design:
# docs/fleet-supervisor-design.md). Per agent it runs DETECT -> CLASSIFY and
# surfaces the result on a board; the cron-callable `--tick` additionally
# APPENDS to the supervisor_events audit table. P1 took ZERO recovery
# actions — no restarts, no nudges, no mutations beyond that audit table —
# so the stuck/slow classifier could be validated against real fleet behavior
# with no risk before P2 turned the recovery ladder on. P2's ladder is
# nudge -> resume -> rotate -> restart (rung 4, poller-dead only, rate-limited:
# DIVE-3753; the rate limit counts restarts that did NOT heal the poller, plus a
# separate flap bound on all of them, DIVE-3915), all of it gated on
# $_SUP_ACTIONS_FLAG.
#
# Signals (all read-only; cheap ones implemented, flaky ones stubbed):
#   service   systemctl is-active on 5dive-agent@<name> (claude-session.service
#             for the box's main `claude` user, when that unit is meant to run)
#   tmux      tmux has-session -t agent-<name>, as the agent's own user
#   poller    telegram bridge process alive, per-type (DIVE-971): claude runs
#             the forked plugin as a bun proc carrying …/5dive-plugins/telegram;
#             codex/grok/antigravity run the telegram-<type> MCP server (bun
#             <dir>/server.ts); opencode's telegram-opencode relay IS its main
#             proc. One pgrep pattern per type (_SUP_POLLER_PAT) — telegram
#             channel only; other channels/types stay "n/a".
#   activity  newest session-transcript mtime, per-type (DIVE-971). Every
#             assistant turn appends to the runtime's transcript, so its mtime
#             IS the last-token-progress timestamp — cheaper and wider-coverage
#             than loop_runs.updated_at (loop work only) and far less flaky than
#             pane-scraping. Per-type roots+globs in _sup_activity_epoch:

#             empty root => age unknown => never stuck (false-negative bias).
#   goalDrift claude-only (DIVE-971): an active /goal targets a specific DIVE
#             task that is still untouched (status=todo) while the agent is
#             actively progressing on something else. Structural, not semantic
#             — no relevance heuristic. Observe-only: never feeds the act ladder.

# Conservative classification knobs (design §4). Bias FALSE-NEGATIVE: missing a
# stuck agent is better than flagging a healthy one, because the P2 ladder's
# restart is disruptive. Env-overridable so the P1 instrumentation phase can

# same audit trail as every other rung (no extra state file).
#
# Why 1 and not 3: the remedy is measured at NINE SECONDS

# ── DIVE-3915: THE CEILING COUNTS RESTARTS THAT DID NOT WORK ─────────────────
# Measured 2026-09-03. `main` and `olivia` both went deaf on telegram inside two
# minutes of each other, both with the same lifecycle signature (a `start` with
# no `boot ok`, the surviving poller SIGHUP'd ~8 min later, silence after). The
# cure on `main` was a plain restart and it took 2.4 SECONDS:
#
#   00:47:25  agent restart      00:47:27.489  launcher      00:47:27.841  boot ok
#
# The supervisor had classified it and could not act:
#
#   ESCALATE main (poller-dead: rung-4-needed)
#   ESCALATE main (poller-dead: restart-rate-limited)
#
# The budget was already spent — by an EARLIER, UNRELATED episode on the same
# seat, hours before, whose restart had WORKED. So the seat sat deaf not because
# the failure was hard but because a successful recovery had consumed the
# allowance for the next one.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT "JUST ALLOW 2", the thing DIVE-3856 wrote an arm to forbid.
# Read the ceiling's own rationale above: *"a restart that works is visible
# before the next 10-minute tick, so a SECOND restart inside the window is never
# the cure for the first one having worked; it is the signature of a seat that
# restarting does not fix."* That sentence is entirely about a restart that DID
# NOT WORK. It was implemented as a count of restarts ATTEMPTED because, when it
# was written, the two were indistinguishable — `result` was cmd_restart's exit
# code and said `ok` either way. DIVE-3856 removed that excuse: the trail now
# records `ok` / `restart-ran-poller-still-dead` / `restart-ran-poller-unverified`
# from an actual poller probe. So the numerator can finally be what the comment
# always claimed: restarts that ran and left the seat deaf.
#
#   _SUP_RESTART_MAX      unhealed restarts per seat per window   (1 — UNCHANGED)
#   _SUP_RESTART_TOTAL_MAX  restarts of ANY outcome per window    (3 — the flap bound)
#
# `unverified` COUNTS AS UNHEALED, deliberately. It is the "I could not tell"
# outcome, and for a type absent from _SUP_POLLER_VERIFY_PAT (opencode) it is the
# only outcome there is — so on every unprobeable seat this ceiling keeps
# behaving exactly as it did before this change. A widening that rests on a probe
# must not widen where the probe is silent.
#
# THE TOTAL CEILING IS WHAT KEEPS THIS BOUNDED. Without it, a seat whose poller
# dies every ten minutes and is cured every time would restart forever and never
# reach a person: each restart verifies ok, so it never accrues an unhealed row.
# That seat is broken in a way a restart is only papering over, and 3 per 6h is
# the number at which we say so out loud (`escalate restart-flapping`) — a
# distinct reason string from `restart-rate-limited`, because "the remedy keeps
# failing" and "the remedy keeps being needed" send a human to different places.

# ── DIVE-3856: RUNG 4 VERIFIES ITS OWN REMEDY ────────────────────────────────
# THE DEFECT, measured on `main` 2026-08-31 (supervisor_events + the seat's
# channels/telegram/lifecycle.log): at 12:30:15 rung 4 restarted a poller-dead
# seat and recorded {"rung":"restart","result":"ok"} — and `result` was
# cmd_restart's EXIT CODE, not the poller's return. The seat was still deaf. The
# lifecycle log has NO launcher line at all between 12:21:28 and 12:45:23, so
# neither that restart nor a hand-run `agent restart` at 12:33:31 spawned a
# channel launcher. Two restarts, both scored ok, both no-ops. The supervisor
# then discovered at 12:40 what was answerable at 12:30:24, and called the
# interval a success.
#
# WHY THE SUPERVISOR IS THE PLACE THIS CAN BE FIXED, and rotate is not: the
# rotation verb's bounce is a `systemd-run --on-active=1` transient unit that
# fires ~1s AFTER the CLI process exits, deliberately (an immediate restart
# SIGTERMs the caller's own sudo subprocess, and rotation is often invoked from
# inside the rotating seat's own bot). A verb cannot attest to an event
# scheduled after its own death — see
# community/wiki/a-deferred-restart-cannot-be-verified-by-the-verb-that-defers-it.md.
# The supervisor has no such problem: it fires the restart itself and it is
# still running afterwards. It just never looked.
#
# THE WAIT IS A POLL, NOT A SLEEP. A poller appears ~9s after the bounce, so a
# probe taken the instant `cmd_restart` returns reads ZERO on a perfectly
# healthy seat — a FALSE RED whose remedy would be another restart. We poll
# once a second and return the moment the poller is back, so the common case
# costs ~9s of one tick and only a genuinely dead seat pays the ceiling. The
# ceiling is per SEAT and this runs inside a 10-minute tick: even the pathological
# fleet-wide case (every seat poller-dead) is bounded by the rung-4 limiter,
# which allows one restart per seat per 6h.

#
#   bun run --cwd ~/.claude/plugins/cache/5dive-plugins/telegram/0.5.49 … start
#       argv contains the plugin dir -> _SUP_POLLER_PAT matches it   THE LAUNCHER
#   /usr/local/bin/bun start.ts
#       argv is two tokens with no path -> _SUP_POLLER_PAT misses it  THE POLLER

#   don                1                            2   <- orphaned poller, board reads healthy
#   main               1                            1
#
# So the classifier's pattern is stable across the server.ts->start.ts rename
# precisely BECAUSE it never matched the poller. It is correct for state 1
# (launcher and poller both gone — the 08-31 outage) and BLIND to state 2
# (launcher alive, poller dead or duplicated). Inheriting it for the
# post-restart probe would grade the launcher we just started and call a still-
# deaf seat cured, which is this row's defect wearing a different hat.
#
# So this predicate names the POLLER, and names BOTH argv shapes: DIVE-3752 put
# the recording launcher in front of `start.ts`, while an older plugin cache and
# the telegram-<x> MCP variants still run `server.ts` (the variants
# path-qualified, hence the optional segment). A server.ts-only predicate reads
# ZERO on five verifiably healthy seats.
#
# `opencode` is ABSENT ON PURPOSE: its relay is `bun run --cwd <plugin> … start`,
# which carries no `.ts` at all, so any pattern here would read zero on a healthy
# seat. A type absent from this table verifies as `unverified` — which never
# claims ok and never claims dead. Same false-negative bias the classifier uses.
#
# NOT re-walked (measured, DIVE-3854/3855): `pgrep -f` MATCHES YOUR OWN COMMAND
# LINE, so our pid and our parent's are dropped explicitly; `sudo pgrep -u
# agent-<n>` FAILS OPEN on a 5dive-only sudo grant ("a password is required"
# exits like a real zero) so plain pgrep is used — the process table is

#
# DIVE-3880 it.2: WHICH matching line is returned is now load-bearing, so the
# selection is part of this function rather than a `head -1`. Before 3880 any
# match meant the same thing (alarm) and picking the first was cosmetic; once a
# `lapsed` deadline DISARMS the alarm, choosing the oldest line lets a seat that
# hit the wall, resumed, and hit it AGAIN inside one pane window report healthy
# while genuinely frozen — the excerpt, not the state machine, carrying the
# false negative. Quota-pressured seats are the only population this detector
# has, so two refusals in a 40-line window is the expected shape.
#
# The window is a SEQUENCE, and it is aggregated, not sampled:
#
#   1. Any match whose deadline is still in the FUTURE wins outright (the
#      latest such deadline). A future expiry printed by the harness itself is
#      unarguable proof the wall is still in force, wherever in the window it
#      sits — so the window can only lapse when EVERY timed match has lapsed.
#   2. Otherwise the LAST match wins — the newest refusal, which supersedes the
#      scrollback above it. Its own state (lapsed, or unknown when it carries no
#      parseable deadline) is the window's state.
#
# Why the newest and not "any unknown pins the alarm": an untimed signature
# (a transient `API Error ... 429`, an older `credit balance is too low`) also
# keeps rendering forever, so treating one anywhere in the window as an
# indefinite freeze re-opens the exact stale-scrollback false positive DIVE-3880
# exists to close. A seat that IS indefinitely frozen re-emits — the pane is
# live evidence and the tick re-reads it — so its newest line says so.

# DIVE-3880: the pane KEEPS RENDERING a lapsed refusal, so the signature alone
# cannot say whether the seat is still frozen — and the discriminator is already
# inside the string being parsed. The harness prints its own resume deadline
# ("continuing automatically at 2:10pm"); compared against now that is three
# states, not two:
#
#   live     deadline in the FUTURE  -> the refusal is in force, the seat IS frozen
#   lapsed   deadline in the PAST    -> scrollback; the seat has already resumed
#   unknown  no deadline in the text, or one this cannot parse
#
# UNKNOWN abstains — it is NEVER resolved to either of the other two. That is
# DIVE-3778's third-state rule, and it is load-bearing in BOTH directions here:
# most quota phrasings carry no deadline at all (`credit balance is too low`,
# `insufficient_quota`, a weekly `7d: 100%`) and those are real, indefinite
# freezes. So an abstention leaves the pre-3880 classification exactly as it
# was and only refuses to claim a live deadline; it is not a clear.
#
# Pure: `now` is an ARGUMENT, never `date +%s` read internally, so every arm is
# assertable at a fixed clock. Echoes "<state>\x1f<deadline-epoch|>".
#
# INVARIANT (DIVE-3880 it.2): the input is ONE pane line — the single excerpt
# _sup_quota_match selected, or the single one `info` inherited from the trail.
# Aggregating a WINDOW of several refusals is that function's job, deliberately
# not this one's: this parses, it does not choose. So the first-match-wins read
# below is over one refusal, and the "which of several lines" question — the one
# it.1 got wrong — is answered exactly once, upstream.
#
# Which of three candidate days: the NEAREST to `now` (yesterday / today /
# tomorrow at that time-of-day). A pane line is undated, so a bare `12:30am`
# read at 23:55 means tomorrow and a bare `11pm` read at 00:05 means yesterday
# — anchoring on today alone gets one of those backwards whichever way you pick.
# RESIDUAL, stated because it cannot be fixed from this surface: a refusal still
# on screen more than ~12h later reads as the same time-of-day TODAY, so it can
# read `live` when it lapsed a day ago. Bounded by the pane window
# (_SUP_QUOTA_PANE_LINES) at the tick, and by _SUP_INFO_TICK_STALE on the `info`
# side; a dated deadline in the text would remove it and no runtime prints one.

# ── DIVE-4052 retires the DIVE-3940/3970 quota-mute apparatus ───────────────
# What used to live here: _sup_quota_selfheal (which refusal shapes resolve on
# their own), the persistence horizons, _sup_quota_escalate_after and
# _sup_quota_episode_first — the machinery that decided WHICH quota walls were
# benign enough to keep off lodar's phone, plus part 2's escape, which took the
# phone back once a muted wall outlived the reset it had promised.
#
# All of it answered one question — "is THIS quota wall worth a human's
# attention?" — and lodar's answer as of 2026-09-08 is that none of them are, on
# EITHER leg: a quota wall is what a subscription does, not an incident. A
# per-shape reading cannot beat that answer, so keeping it would be a decision
# procedure with nothing left to decide. _SUP_QUOTA_ALERTS_FLAG is now the whole
# policy for the class: absent, the audited row only; present, both legs,
# unfiltered — a debug mode that hides shapes from you is not a debug mode.
#
# Part 2 in particular was not merely redundant, it was WRONG. Measured
# 2026-09-08 ~16:45Z: main received "STILL WALLED 81h ... this is now a hard
# wall" about a seat whose own quoted pane said "continuing automatically at
# 5pm". mp-team is a shared profile that walls every 5h window, so the episode
# chain never breaks, the horizon expires, and the escalation fires on a wall
# that is self-healing exactly as designed. Retiring it removes a false claim,
# not a safety net. (_sup_quota_deadline SURVIVES — DIVE-3880 classification and
# the quota-lapsed disarm read it, and neither is about notification.)

# DIVE-3272: does this agent's live pane show a capacity refusal? Root-only (the
# sudo tmux hop) and running-service-only; anything else returns empty
# (false-negative bias, like every other probe here). Deliberately NOT
# claude-only — the incident seat was a qwen profile, and a quota wall is the one
# failure every runtime shares.
# The root tmux hop, split out from _sup_quota_pane (DIVE-3880 it.2) so the
# forwarding below is reachable from a unit test. Everything ungradable lives
# here — the EUID gate, the sudo, the capture — and it is the ONE thing a test

# ── DIVE-3274: the same two facts, on the surface people actually type ────────
#
# DIVE-3272 taught the supervisor BOARD to see a seat that is up and closing
# nothing. `agent info` — the drill-down people actually type — kept printing
# only the systemd/registry LIVENESS label, so the defect survived there intact:
# a dark seat and a working one printed the same `state: active / enabled`. Four
# people trusted that line about dev3 for four days
# (community/wiki/every-signal-measured-liveness-none-measured-output.md).
#
# The two capacity classes are NOT equally measurable from this surface, and the
# overlay says which is which rather than flattening them into one confident
# label:
#
#   no-output        A PURE STORE READ. `info` re-runs _sup_output_stats itself,
#                    so this half is MEASURED at print time — it holds on a box
#                    where the tick has never run, and it cannot go stale.
#   quota-exhausted  Needs a root `tmux capture-pane` hop. `info` is read-only
#                    and runs as any seat (ensure_state_ro), so it must not grow
#                    one; this half is INHERITED from the event trail. It is
#                    therefore printed WITH its age and the tick's arm state and
#                    never as a bare classification — an unmeasured branch has
#                    to say less than the measured one (DIVE-2793), and an
#                    unarmed monitor otherwise prints exactly what a quiet one
#                    prints (DIVE-2306). That is the same defect one level up:
#                    silence from an instrument nobody armed reading as an
#                    all-clear is how this class hides in the first place.
#
# Freshness is decided by COMPARING the agent's newest row against the newest
# fleet heartbeat, not by a wall-clock guess: the tick writes an `observe` row
# EVERY tick for every non-healthy class (see cmd_supervisor_tick), so an agent
# whose newest row predates the newest heartbeat was looked at and found
# healthy. No row at all + no heartbeat at all is `unobserved`, which is a third
# value on purpose — it must not read as either healthy or dry.
# How long before the OBSERVER ITSELF is stale. `healthy` derived from a tick
# that stopped running is the absence-reads-as-health shape this row exists to
# remove (main, at the DIVE-3274 push approval), so past this bound the overlay
# reports `unobserved` and names the age: the recorded reading is not refuted,
# it is simply no longer current, and a surface that cannot tell those apart is
# the defect. 1h is 6x the shipped `*/10` cron. Env-overridable in the house
# style because `info` CANNOT see the cron that drives the tick — a box on a
# slower schedule would otherwise read `unobserved` forever, which is honest but
# useless, and the knob is cheaper than a wrong constant.

# --tick: the cron-callable observe pass — detect + classify + AUDIT, nothing

# agent per tick when classification != healthy, plus one 'transition' row
# whenever an agent's classification changed since its last recorded row
# (including recovery back to healthy, so the trail shows both edges). The
# previous classification is derived from the agent's latest event row —
# healthy when it has none — so the tick needs no extra state file.
# ── P2 (DIVE-857): recovery ladder — ACT + ESCALATE (design §5–6) ───────────
# Auto-act was narrow along ONE axis: causes where the session is alive but
# wedged (no-progress, loop-stuck). Everything else stuck ESCALATES: one audit
# row per window, zero mutations. Rungs 1-3, in order: nudge -> resume -> rotate.
#
# DIVE-3753 adds rung 4 for ONE cause: poller-dead -> restart, rate-limited to
# _SUP_RESTART_MAX UNHEALED restarts per seat per _SUP_RESTART_WINDOW_H, and
# _SUP_RESTART_TOTAL_MAX restarts of any outcome in the same window (DIVE-3915 —
# a successful recovery no longer spends the allowance for the next, unrelated
# episode; see the ceiling's block comment). Reprovision stays manual
# and every other rung-4+ cause still escalates. The gap it closes was measured
# on 2026-08-26: `ESCALATE <seat> (poller-dead: rung-4-needed)` fired correctly
# for four seats and NOTHING SERVED IT, so a correct detection produced no
# action for 2h33m while 9 human gates sat pending — including on the
# coordinator seat, i.e. the fleet's human-in-the-loop path was dark and the
# supervisor knew.
#
# OSS-23 (self-heal every runtime): the ladder is RUNTIME-AGNOSTIC — codex, grok,
# opencode, and antigravity get the same nudge/resume/rotate as claude, not just
# claude. It always could be: every rung is a generic op on the agent's tmux
# session + registry, with no claude-specific assumption. nudge/resume inject a
# line (+ a modal-clearing Escape) into the `agent-<name>` tmux pane every runtime
# shares (_hb_send_line); rotate cycles among SAME-TYPE accounts and is already
# gated on per-agent rotation.enabled (a non-claude agent with no rotation pool
# just escalates at rung 2, same as claude). The old claude-only gate was a
# DIVE-857 caution, not a technical limit; without cross-runtime recovery the
# OSS-18 autonomy ledger's self-heal-recovery signal would be claude-biased
# (design: community/wiki/earned-autonomy-design-jul11.md §Sequencing #1).

# attempts + last-action epoch for an agent inside the rolling window, straight
# from the audit trail (no extra state file — same principle as the tick's
# transition detection). Echoes "attempts lastEpoch" (lastEpoch=0 when none).
#
# DIVE-3753: rung-4 restart rows are EXCLUDED. The two ladders are indexed
# differently — nudge/resume/rotate pick their rung by ATTEMPT COUNT, restart
# picks it by CAUSE — so counting a restart as an attempt would silently move
# the next no-progress on that seat from nudge to resume (and, at three, retire
# the ladder to escalate) because of an action taken for an unrelated cause.
# Sharing one counter between a count-indexed ladder and a cause-indexed rung
# makes each one's pacing depend on the other's traffic.

# ── DIVE-4097: DOOR 2 — the P2 ladder holds for a seat behind a capacity wall ──
#
# The capacity wall has TWO doors and #798 (DIVE-4052) closed only door 1. Door 1
# is the quota-exhausted ALERT leg: it is now audited-row-only unless
# _SUP_QUOTA_ALERTS_FLAG is set, so no phone rings for a seat the tick actually
# CLASSIFIED as quota-exhausted. Door 2 is this ladder, and it was left wide open,
# because the string that opened this row is not classified quota-exhausted at all:
#
#   "Agent codex is stuck and needs a person — no-progress (rotation-disabled)"
#
# _sup_classify only reaches the quota-exhausted branch when the refusal is inside
# the pane window this tick reads (_SUP_QUOTA_PANE_LINES). On the ticks where the
# seat has scrolled past its own refusal — or has printed nothing at all, which is
# what a walled seat does — the very same wall classifies as stuck/no-progress, the
# ladder runs, and rung 3 escalates `rotation-disabled` to a human. The seat is not
# wedged; it is throttled and self-healing, and it resumes on its own.
#
# Worse than the page: those ticks were also SPENDING the ladder's attempt counter.
# Alternating classifications walked codex from rung 0 to rung 3 without a single
# tick's evidence that a nudge or a resume was ever the right remedy.
#
# THIS IS DELIBERATELY NOT A SELF-HEAL READING. Iterations 1-2 of this row built a
# horizon over _sup_quota_selfheal / _sup_quota_escalate_after / episode-first, and
# #798 deleted all three by lodar's decision: capacity alerting is answered
# per-CLASS, not per-shape. A per-shape decision procedure has nothing left to
# decide, so door 2 asks the one question that survives — *is this seat behind a
# capacity wall right now* — and holds. No horizon, no threshold, no new knob.
#
# TWO INPUTS, and note that neither is a clock read inside this function:
#
#   1. The AUDIT TRAIL. Door 1 files a quota-exhausted supervisor_events row every
#      _SUP_ALERT_WINDOW_H, unconditionally, for as long as the wall is up — #798
#      names that row as the whole of what still covers a walled seat. It is
#      therefore the only durable attestation of the wall, and it is exactly the
#      evidence the pane no longer carries on the tick that pages. Reused as the
#      hold's oracle AND as its expiry: outside that window the wall stopped being
#      re-attested, so the hold lapses on its own. This is the existing constant
#      that governs the re-filing; it is not a second threshold laid on top.
#   2. The PANE, via _sup_quota_deadline (which SURVIVES #798 — DIVE-3880
#      classification is untouched). A `lapsed` reading is a positive statement
#      that the refusal on screen has EXPIRED and the seat has resumed, so it
#      RELEASES the hold on the spot however fresh the audit row is. That is the
#      arm that stops this going quiet forever: a seat still not progressing after
#      its own wall demonstrably came down is genuinely stuck and pages.
#      (`live` and `unknown` never arrive here — _sup_classify routes both to
#      quota-exhausted, so a stuck row carrying a signature carries `lapsed`.)
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT TOUCH: service-dead, tmux-dead and poller-dead act and escalate
# exactly as before. A walled seat can ALSO be genuinely dead, and a dead unit is
# the more specific reading — holding those would trade a false page for a missed
# outage. Only no-progress and loop-stuck, the two causes a capacity wall actually
# explains, can be held.
#
# THE BOUNDARY FAILURE MODE IS A NUDGE, NOT A PAGE, and that is by construction:
# a `defer` writes no action row (see the dispatch's `case "$verb" in defer`), so a
# held seat spends nothing and stays at attempt 0. If the hold lapses for one tick
# at the window edge, the ladder resumes at rung 0 — a nudge — never at rung 3.

# OPTIONAL so every existing 6-arg caller keeps its exact meaning (0 spent).
#
# The 8th parameter is whether the ladder is ARMED ($_SUP_ACTIONS_FLAG). It is
# here rather than at the dispatch because of a regression this rung would

# ── DIVE-3727: escalation DELIVERY — a path that does not traverse the sick seat ──
#
# DIVE-3726 measured the entire defect. The poller-dead classification for `main`
# was CORRECT, it fired, it wrote its audit row and its warn line — and it reached
# nobody, because the only channel that would have carried it to a human was
# `main`'s own dead Telegram. A seat cannot escalate its own unreachability
# through itself. Detection was never the gap; delivery was.
#
# So an escalation picks a COURIER: an enabled agent that is (a) NOT the sick seat
# and (b) not itself classified stuck in this same tick — routing a report about a
# dead seat through a second dead seat reproduces the bug one hop over. The
# candidate order comes from the tick's own snapshot, so no registry re-read and no
# org-chart walk can disagree with what was just classified.
#
# Two rails, tried in order, because they fail INDEPENDENTLY — that independence is
# the finding behind
# community/wiki/a-green-agent-can-still-be-unreachable-probe-the-poller-lock.md:
#
#   1. telegram — `_task_send_owner` under the COURIER's channel. Outbound
#      sendMessage and inbound getUpdates are separate halves of the Bot API, so a
#      courier reaches the paired human directly with no agent in the loop and no
#      dependence on the sick seat's poller. This is the rail that puts it in front
#      of a human within the tick.
#   2. a2a — `agent send` to the courier. Slower (a human sees it when the courier
#      relays) and it needs no channel state at all, which is exactly why it is the
#      fallback: the a2a rail was up throughout the DIVE-3726 outage, and that is
#      how DIVE-3726 was worked at all.
#
# `_task_send_owner`'s own fail-closed chokepoint (`_task_human_send_allowed`)
# still applies and is deliberately not bypassed: a fixture/e2e task DB must not
# reach a paired human just because the sender is the supervisor.
#
# Set SUPERVISOR_ESCALATE_DELIVER=0 to classify and audit exactly as before with
# no send — the knob a dry run or a fixture tick uses. It is NOT a way to silence a
# noisy escalation; the escalate row is already deduped to one per

# ── DIVE-3667: fleet rollup — count EVERY class, not a hand-picked five ──────
#
# The tick's rollup used to enumerate healthy/slow/stuck/drift/verify-challenge
# by hand. `stalled` was in none of them, so the one class that means ACTIONABLE
# WORK IS STRANDED ON A SEAT THAT IS NOT WORKING IT had zero unattended surface:
# not counted, not printed, not in the heartbeat row's signals, and — unlike
# no-output and quota-exhausted — not on the alert path either. The board
# (_sup_render_board / _sup_summary_line) printed it correctly the whole time;
# only the cron form, the one that runs with nobody watching, dropped it.
#
# Measured 2026-08-22 (DIVE-3665): supervisor_events held six consecutive
# observe/stalled/idle-stranded rows for one seat holding a delivered, unstarted
# high-priority row, while supervisor-tick.log printed
#   "17 agents — 16 healthy / 0 slow / 0 drift / 0 stuck"
# every 10 minutes. The ONLY symptom was a total that did not add up, which
# reads as a rounding artifact rather than as stranded work.
#
# These three helpers are deliberately pure and separately callable: the
# counting is a `group_by` over whatever classes the classifier actually
# emitted, and `unclassified` is what keeps a class added AFTER this commit from
# disappearing the same way. Adding a class no longer requires editing the
# rollup — it requires nothing.

# _sup_rollup_counts <snap-json>
# Emits ten tab-separated counts, in this fixed order:
#   healthy slow stuck drift verify-challenge stalled no-output update-pending
#   quota-exhausted unclassified
# `unclassified` is total minus the nine named — it is the invariant that makes
# the printed buckets sum to the agent count, and the alarm for a new class.
