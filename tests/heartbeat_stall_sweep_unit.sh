# TIER: nightly — 20.3s measured on the 5dive host, worktree 5dive-cli-wt-2207 (DIVE-2525): does not fit the 300s PR core; the nightly sweep runs it. Was 12.4s; DIVE-2207 added 14 arms (the (a3) post-gate-answer rail and the gap#3 label/parked-term arms), each of which drives a full _hb_stall_sweep.
# DIVE-1416 isolated unit harness for _hb_stall_sweep (cmd_heartbeat.sh) —
# fleet-stall self-heal gaps #2 and #3 (gap #1 is _hb_blocked_sweep, covered by
# tests/task_cascade_unblock_unit.sh):
#   (a) gap#2 — surface a maker->verifier delivery that's sat unacknowledged
#       past _HB_VERIFY_STALE_MIN (handoff_delivered_at, stamped by
#       _task_route_to_verifier), throttled once per delivery.
#   (b) gap#3 core — fleet-idle-while-actionable-work-is-open, alarms only once
#       the condition has PERSISTED past _HB_STALL_MIN_MINUTES, re-alarms on
#       the same cadence while it holds, clears when it resolves.
#   (c) gap#3 canary — pinger liveness: eligible-for-ping gates existing while
#       gate_pinged_at hasn't advanced fleet-wide in over an hour.
# Same isolation contract as the other harnesses: source src/ directly,
# throwaway tasks.db (STATE_DIR -> tmp), cmd_send stubbed so no tmux/network is
# touched. Run: bash tests/heartbeat_stall_sweep_unit.sh (no root, no network).
set -uo pipefail

# DIVE-2211: name the tree this harness grades (tests/lib/grading_tree.sh).
# Three-state: if the helper is unreachable (a staged copy that did not carry
# tests/lib/), the log says NO TREE WAS NAMED rather than falling silent, and a
# `set -e` harness is not killed by a failed source.
# NOTE the absence of `2>/dev/null`. The obvious hardening -- redirect the
# source's stderr so bash's "No such file" does not litter the log -- also
# swallows the helper's own stderr line, which IS the payload. That silenced all
# 210 harnesses at once while every other check in this change stayed green.
