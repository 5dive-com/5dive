# DIVE-1416 (gap#3) isolated unit harness for _sup_classify (cmd_supervisor.sh)
# — the pure classification decision factored out of _sup_agent_record so it's
# directly testable without stubbing systemctl/tmux/pgrep (mirrors how
# tests/supervisor_unit.sh already exercises _sup_act_plan). Focuses on the new
# "stalled"/idle-stranded class: an agent with NO active work but an old todo
# task still sitting assigned to it — the "idle while work is stranded" signal
# the fleet-stall dogfood incident found supervisor didn't model at all.
# Run: bash tests/supervisor_classify_unit.sh (no root, no network).

# Three-state: if the helper is unreachable (a staged copy that did not carry
# tests/lib/), the log says NO TREE WAS NAMED rather than falling silent, and a
# `set -e` harness is not killed by a failed source.
# NOTE the absence of `2>/dev/null`. The obvious hardening -- redirect the
# source's stderr so bash's "No such file" does not litter the log -- also
# swallows the helper's own stderr line, which IS the payload. That silenced all

#     Under `set -euo pipefail` a no-match grep makes the pipeline rc=1, so
#     `_sup_quota_match` DIED on a clean pane — the overwhelmingly common one —
#     and `_sup_quota_pane` returned 1 on its healthy path. Today the single
#     production call site is `quota_excerpt=$(…)`, which masks it, so the arms
#     above all stayed green: the defect is invisible to a VERDICT arm and only
#     shows in the caller's control flow.
#     scripts/unguarded-probe-scan.sh names the site and
#     tests/unguarded_probe_substitution_unit.sh reds on it, but both grade the
#     TEXT; neither states the runtime consequence. And this harness runs
#     `set -uo pipefail` WITHOUT `-e`, so a bare call here cannot fire the bug
#     at all — the arm has to RE-ENTER the firing environment or it grades a
#     shell the defect is unreachable from.
#     TRAP, and the reason the first draft of these four arms was VACUOUS (they
#     were green with the guard deleted): bash suppresses `-e` for any command
#     in an `&&`/`||`/`!` list, and that suppression PROPAGATES INTO A SUBSHELL,
#     so `( set -euo pipefail; … ) || echo DIED` cannot fire — the `set -e` is
#     overridden by the context the subshell was invoked from. The sentinel has
#     to be read out of the subshell's STDOUT inside a plain command
#     substitution instead, where an absent sentinel is the death.

# --- DIVE-3880: THE WIRING, driven through _sup_agent_record ------------------
#     A pure-classifier arm grades the BRANCH and not the READ
#     (community/wiki/a-detectors-tests-can-grade-the-branch-and-not-the-read.md):
#     with the decision correct, arg 17 can still be fed a constant and the
#     detector reads exactly as it did before the fix. Measured: hardcoding
#     "unknown" at the call site survived every arm above. So this drives the
#     real record path with the probes stubbed — the excerpt comes from a
#     stubbed pane, the deadline state is derived inside the function, and only
#     the emitted JSON is asserted.
rec() {  # <pane-line> <now>
  # NOT named `pane`: bash locals are DYNAMICALLY scoped, so the real
  # _sup_quota_pane's own `local pane` shadows this one at the moment the
  # stubbed capture reads it (measured: `pane: unbound variable` under set -u).
