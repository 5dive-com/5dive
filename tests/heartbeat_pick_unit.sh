# DIVE-979 isolated unit harness for dependency-aware heartbeat scheduling.
#
# Exercises _hb_pick_task (cmd_heartbeat.sh) over a small dep graph on a
# throwaway tasks.db — never touches the live shared board (STATE_DIR -> tmp,
# same posture as goal_add_unit.sh). Asserts: a todo with an OPEN blocker is
# never handed out; a blocker going done/cancelled makes the dependent
# eligible; within a priority tier the longer critical path is preferred; and
# priority still dominates critical-path depth. DIVE-4053 also pins the human-
# gate boundary on the picker itself: an unanswered gate is not runnable while
# an ungated row assigned to the same agent remains selectable.
# Run: bash tests/heartbeat_pick_unit.sh  (no root, no network).
set -uo pipefail

# DIVE-2211: name the tree this harness grades (tests/lib/grading_tree.sh).
# Three-state: if the helper is unreachable (a staged copy that did not carry
# tests/lib/), the log says NO TREE WAS NAMED rather than falling silent, and a
# `set -e` harness is not killed by a failed source.
# NOTE the absence of `2>/dev/null`. The obvious hardening -- redirect the
# source's stderr so bash's "No such file" does not litter the log -- also
# swallows the helper's own stderr line, which IS the payload. That silenced all
# 210 harnesses at once while every other check in this change stayed green.
