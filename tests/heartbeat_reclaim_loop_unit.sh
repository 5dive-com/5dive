# DIVE-4104 — isolated unit harness for the three reclaim rules this ticket
# changes, plus the fixture replay of the four rows that actually bounced.
#
# THE BUG, measured over the 7 days to 2026-09-08: the heartbeat reclaimed
# quinn's claimed rows 88 times across 40 distinct rows — 51 `idle`, 31
# `session gone`, 6 real 45m overruns — and 17 deliveries that week carry
# "re-delivery of the same pass, not rework". Three of the four buckets are not
# neglect: a quota-walled pane reads byte-identical to an abandoned one through
# `_hb_agent_idle`; a `session gone` on an already-DELIVERED row hands back as
# buildable work a pass whose maker owes nothing; and a `session gone` that
# left its pushed branch sitting in a local checkout lost no work at all.
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES, arm by arm:
#   1  CONTROL — session gone on a delivery the VERIFIER still holds keeps it on
#      the verifier with the handoff intact. This already held before the fix
#      (_hb_reclaim_to_todo never wrote `assignee`), so the ticket's premise that
#      the reclaim bounces such a row to the maker is WRONG and this arm exists
#      to pin the behaviour, not to grade the change;
#  1b  THE ARM THAT GRADES IT — a live, ungraded delivery found on the MAKER's
#      queue (the shape DIVE-4085 was in when the dispatcher picked it up for dev
#      at 17:00 on 09-08) is returned to the VERIFIER with the handoff intact
#      instead of being requeued as buildable work, and the ledger says so;
#   2  CONTROL — session gone on a row with NO live delivery and no branch
#      reclaims to plain todo on the same seat, exactly as before;
#   3  idle-stall on a seat the supervisor currently classifies
#      `quota-exhausted` -> PARKED: nothing reclaimed, claim left in_progress;
#   4  CONTROL — the same idle-stall on a seat classified `healthy` reclaims
#      normally, so the park is scoped to the wall and not to the seat;
#   5  CONTROL — a walled seat that ALSO overran the 45m budget is still
#      reclaimed by rule (c): the park narrows exactly one arm;
#   6  CONTROL — an EXPIRED park (quota-exhausted observed 7h ago, no parseable
#      deadline) reclaims normally: a park can never wedge a claim forever;
#   7  a parseable `quotaDeadline` parks to the deadline plus one tick, and a
#      deadline already in the past does not park;
#   8  session gone with the row's pushed branch still checked out -> the claim
#      is KEPT IN PLACE (status stays in_progress, started_at untouched);
#  8d  THE HOLD IS BOUNDED — the same intact workspace 600m past the 45m budget
#      is reclaimed: rule (a)'s `continue` never touches started_at, so an
#      unbounded hold re-fires forever and (b)/(c) are never reached;
# 8e/f  the bound IS the budget — 44m still holds, 46m lapses;
#  8g  a LAPSED hold is not swallowed by DIVE-2560's verifier-latency skip, the
#      one rule between (a) and (c) that could re-create the wedge;
#   9  CONTROL — the same row with the branch gone reclaims normally, so arm 8
#      rests on positive evidence, never on an unreadable probe;
#  10  REPLAY — the four rows that bounced on 2026-09-08 (DIVE-4085, 4071,
#      4090, 4088), each delivered to quinn and hit by a `session gone`, all
#      stay on quinn as delivered instead of going back to their makers.

# 1b) THE SHAPE THAT ACTUALLY BOUNCED, and the reason arm 1 above is labelled a
# control rather than the fix. `_hb_reclaim_to_todo` never wrote `assignee`, so a
# reclaim of a row the VERIFIER still held always left it on the verifier — the
# ticket's premise that the reclaim itself bounces the row to the maker does not
# hold, and this harness proved it: arm 1 passes on the pre-fix tree too.
#
# What was measured on the board is one state further on. DIVE-4085 was delivered
# to quinn at 07:19 and at 17:00 the dispatcher picked it up FOR DEV, whose picker
# is `assignee=<seat>` — so by then something had moved `assignee` off the verifier
# while handoff_delivered_at was set and handoff_ack_at was still NULL. That writer
# is not identified (no task.reclaimed, no task.rejected, no nudge-enforce
# reassignment on the row), so this fix does not try to name it: it makes the
# reclaim IDEMPOTENT ABOUT THE HANDOFF instead. A live, ungraded delivery goes back
# to the verifier's queue whoever is holding the row, so the churn dies at the
# reclaim regardless of which writer set it up. THIS is the arm the fix has to pass
# and the pre-fix tree cannot.

# The shape DIVE-4161 went round four times and DIVE-4108 ten: a verifier has
# graded the pass, the delivery is bound, and the outstanding act is a merge

# here in _hb_reclaim. That inverted the ticket's own axis: the dispatch tick's
# busy-guard counts EVERY in_progress row for the seat and returns one level
# ABOVE the picker, so a standing claim on a row nobody here owes made the seat
# undispatchable onto ANY row until another seat merged -- 57% wasted attempts
# becoming 0 attempts, and an unbounded hold whose exit is not this seat's act,
# the exact class arms 6 and 8d of this file exist to forbid.
#
# The correct half is the PICKER clause (tests/heartbeat_pick_unit.sh): the row
# reclaims to todo, the seat is dispatchable again, and the picker still refuses
# to hand the graded row back. Zero wasted re-pick AND zero wedge. Nothing is
# lost by reclaiming: the board paints the row graded-to-merge off _TASKS_TFV_SQL
# whether it is todo or in_progress.
