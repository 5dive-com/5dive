# DIVE-4176 — THE HUMAN-ASK READABILITY CHECK IS A REFUSAL, NOT AN IGNORED WARNING.
#
# lodar, 2026-08-12: "I cannot understand most of the tech stuff when I got to my
# human gate". The check has existed as a warning since DIVE-3661 and is ignored:
# the parent row DIVE-4150 was warned that its 34-word ask "will render cut" and
# was filed anyway, unchanged. A warning delivered to a headless filer is read by
# nobody. This grades the refusal that replaced it.
#
# EVERY REFUSAL IS PAIRED WITH A CONTROL THAT MUST STILL FILE. The cheap way to
# pass "the unreadable ask was refused" is for cmd_task_need to be unreachable,
# mis-sourced or refusing everything, and a lone red exit cannot tell that apart
# from the rule working. The controls are the load-bearing half here:
#
#   * a tier-1 (lead-routed) gate with the SAME unreadable ask must still file —
#     that gate is read by an AGENT, and refusing it would bounce 83% of the
#     30-day tier-1 corpus over a rule about a reader who is not on that gate;
#   * the lodar-readable asks that survived the 30-day replay must still file,
#     verbatim, or the refusal is a redesign rather than a tightening;
#   * the English neighbours of each jargon shape (out-of-band, read/write,
#     19/19, a bare token budget) must not be read as jargon.
#
# Assertions read the RECORD (need_type / status / audit rows) as well as the
# exit status, because a refusal that exits non-zero AFTER writing the gate would
# pass an rc-only assertion while leaving the ping it refused standing.
#
# Run: bash tests/gate_ask_readability_unit.sh   (no root, no network)
