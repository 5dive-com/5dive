# DIVE-3465 unit harness: a retryable rate limit and a hard spend cap are TWO
# states, and the dispatcher must not collapse them.
#
# The defect this guards: `_hb_pane_is_usage_limit` (DIVE-1666) answers only "is
# this seat parked on a wall dialog" and matches the monthly-spend and 5-hour
# variants alike, so every wall got the RETRY response — press-continue, restart,
# re-nudge. Against a rolling 5h window that is correct. Against a monthly spend
# ceiling it cannot help, and each retry is a whole dispatched session that
# produces nothing: ~20 of 50 analysed sessions accomplished literally nothing,
# and DIVE-3384 was re-attempted across 15+ sessions while still reading `todo`.
#
# What is asserted here:
#   1. _hb_wall_class discriminates the two walls on real dialog text, with the
#      monthly-spend case FIRST-WINS over its own "wait for limit to reset" line
#      (the ordering bug that would make every hard cap read as retryable);
#   2. it has a THIRD outcome — undetermined — and never folds "could not tell"
#      into the retry verdict;
#   3. negative controls: ordinary prompts, and a pane that merely QUOTES a wall
#      (this row's own body does), must not classify as a wall at all;
#   4. the dispatch hold arms, survives an unrelated counter clear, and is
#      released only by a live measurement — with an unreadable probe returning
#      COULD-NOT-DETERMINE rather than headroom.
# Run: bash tests/heartbeat_spend_cap_unit.sh  (no root, no network, no tmux).

# --- 1. The two walls, on the text Claude Code actually prints ----------------
# The monthly-spend dialog CONTAINS "wait for limit to reset", so the HEADER has
# to be the discriminator and the action line must not be. NOTE what this arm
# does and does not reach: it dies on the rate-limit arm's FIRST grep (`monthly
# spend limit` contains no `usage limit` / `weekly limit`), so it proves the
# header wins — it does NOT exercise block order. The arm that does is section
# 1b, and the difference was found by quinn mutating this tree (DIVE-3465 it.1).

# --- 1b. THE ORDERING REGRESSION, on a pane that satisfies BOTH arms ----------
# Order in _hb_wall_class is only load-bearing for a pane that would match the

# pane — so swapping the two guard clauses left the whole corpus green while
# turning a hard cap into a retry. That is the exact collapse this row exists to
# stop, one tidy-up reorder away.
#
# This pane is not exotic: `Usage limit reached` is the header on the harness's
# own CREDIT fixture below, and a monthly ceiling surfacing under it satisfies
# the rate-limit arm's limit-word grep (`usage limit`) AND its reset-phrase grep
# (`wait for ... limit to reset`) while also naming a spend ceiling.
#
#   shipped order (spend-cap tested first)  -> spend-cap   <- the only safe answer
#   swapped order (reset-time tested first) -> rate-limit  <- the defect
#
# MUTATION RECEIPT (DIVE-3465 it.2, run before the fixture was called done):
# with the spend-cap and rate-limit blocks swapped in src/cmd_heartbeat.sh, THESE
# arms fail and the rest of the corpus stays green. If a future edit reorders
# those blocks, this is the assertion that must go red first.
