# DIVE-2582 unit harness for scripts/fold-changelog-fragments.sh — the
# conflict-free changelog.d/ path. Covers:
#   - two fragments fold in, newest filename first, above the existing content
#   - README.md in changelog.d/ is never treated as a fragment
#   - a missing changelog.d/ folds 0, exit 0 (not an error — nothing pending)
#   - a fragment that doesn't start with '## Unreleased' is reported and
#     skipped: not folded into CHANGELOG.md, not deleted from changelog.d/
#   - a bare '## Unreleased' (no em-dash headline) is accepted
#
# DIVE-2702 extends it with the arm that was missing — IDEMPOTENCE ACROSS CUTS,
# graded the only way that means anything here: a real scratch git repo cut THREE
# times, the fold run detached exactly as release-cut.yml runs it, asserting each
# tag's CHANGELOG carries only its own entries. Two cuts would not have caught the
# obvious wrong fix (checking only the immediately previous tag's notes), because
# the compounding shows up on the THIRD. Extended in place rather than added as a
# new harness — tests/lib/tier.sh's ledger argument, the corpus is at its cap.
