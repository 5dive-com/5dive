spawn and manage AI agents that talk to each other.

> MIT. The same binary that runs every agent on [5dive.com](https://5dive.com) — no open-core split. Skip the ops with the managed VM, or run your own.

---

## Quickstart

```sh
# 1. install
curl -fsSL https://install.5dive.com | sudo bash

# 2. create your first agent
5dive init
```

Talk to an agent from your phone — wire it to a Telegram bot ([BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) gives you the token):

```sh
5dive agent create my-agent --type=claude --channels=telegram --telegram-token=<token>
5dive agent pair   my-agent --code=<pairing-code>
```

For scripted / CI setup, see `5dive init --help`.

---

## How it works

Each agent is its own Linux user running an official agentic AI CLI (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, ...) as a systemd service. They reach each other by invoking the same `5dive` CLI — that *is* the bus. Channels like Telegram attach per agent.

```text
            one host
 ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
 │  coder      writer       pm      │
 │ (claude)   (gemini)    (codex)   │
 │    │          │           │      │
 │    └────  5dive CLI  ─────┘      │
 │       send · ask · logs          │
 └──────────────────────────────────┘
        ↕ Telegram / Discord
        (attach per agent)
```

No broker, no protocol, no orchestrator. Shared filesystem, shared CLI.

## Why 5dive

**A team that works without you.** Multiple agents on one host, coordinating with each other.

**Runs as a service, not a session.** Your agents stay alive when you close the terminal. Message them from Telegram any time.

**Every major agentic AI CLI.** `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `hermes`, `openclaw`, `opencode` — under one team.

**A subscription that's yours.** Official `claude` CLI on your own Pro/Max — no middleman, no OAuth proxy, Anthropic-policy safe.

**Safe by default.** Each agent is its own Linux user under one of three isolation tiers — sandbox an agent and it can't read your home dir or sudo your box.

---

## Want a dashboard?

The CLI is the OSS surface — every verb here, every agent, every host, all driven from `/usr/local/bin/5dive`.

If you'd rather click than `ssh`, [5dive.com](https://5dive.com) is the managed version: same CLI under the hood, but the VM, hardening, backups, and dashboard are run for you.

## Agent types

| Type | Model family | Auth | Channels |
|------|-------------|------|----------|
| `claude`   | Anthropic Claude | OAuth / API key | Telegram, Discord |
| `codex`    | OpenAI Codex     | OAuth / API key | — |
| `gemini`   | Google Gemini    | OAuth / API key | — |
| `hermes`   | third-party multi-provider harness | OAuth (OpenAI) / API key | Telegram, Discord |
| `openclaw` | third-party multi-provider harness | OAuth (OpenAI) / API key | Telegram, Discord |
| `opencode` | OpenCode | API key | — |

`hermes` and `openclaw` are community-built harnesses that can route to many providers (OpenRouter, Anthropic, Google, Moonshot, etc.). As of April 4, 2026, Anthropic and Google no longer permit routing consumer subscription OAuth (Claude Pro/Max, Gemini) through third-party harnesses — for that work, use the official `claude` or `gemini` types with your own API key.

## Commands at a glance

```
5dive agent list / create / start / stop / restart / rm
5dive agent send <name> <text>
5dive agent ask  <name> <text> [--timeout=120]
5dive agent logs <name> [--follow]
5dive agent <name> tui

5dive account   add / login / list / show / rename / remove
5dive auth      set / login / status     # lower-level; account is the human path
5dive skill     add / list / remove
5dive doctor [--repair] [--json]
5dive watch                              # htop-style live view
5dive compose up / down / ps             # declarative agents via 5dive.yaml
```

Full flag reference: `5dive --help` (or `5dive <verb> --help`). Machine-readable output on any command via `--json`.

---

## Accounts (shared auth profiles)

One sign-in, many agents:

```sh
5dive account add   work
5dive account login work --type=claude
5dive agent create agent-a --type=claude --auth-profile=work
5dive agent create agent-b --type=claude --auth-profile=work
```

Rename or rotate the account, every bound agent rebinds automatically.

---

## Isolation tiers

| Tier | Access |
|------|--------|
| `admin` (default) | full host |
| `standard` | shared read, limited write |
| `sandboxed` | own home only, no sudo, systemd resource limits |

```sh
5dive agent create my-agent --type=claude --isolation=sandboxed
```

---

## No middlemen

5dive runs on your server. Auth tokens go to model providers directly — never to us. No telemetry, no error reporting, no usage data leaves the box. Each agent is one Linux user with its own login.

Long form: [your auth tokens don't touch us →](https://blog.5dive.com/blog/your-auth-tokens-dont-touch-us/).

---

## Securing your server

5dive runs agents with shell access. Standard hygiene applies:

- patch the OS (`unattended-upgrades`)
- SSH key-only, no root login
- firewall default-deny
- per-agent isolation tiers
- Telegram bot allowlists

Baselines: [devsec.os_hardening](https://github.com/dev-sec/ansible-collection-hardening) · [Lynis](https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis) · [fail2ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/). Or skip the checklist — [5dive.com](https://5dive.com) handles it.

## Other paths

**[Docker](docker/README.md)** — kick the tires without a host install:
```sh
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t 5dive .
docker run -d --name 5dive-demo --privileged 5dive
docker exec -it 5dive-demo bash
```

**Offline / air-gapped** — `install.sh` reads from `$REPO` (default GitHub raw). Override with `REPO=file:///path/to/local/tree` and pre-install apt deps. The fetched files are listed at the top of `install.sh`.

**Context rot** — long sessions degrade. Restart daily via cron:
```cron
0 4 * * * curl -fsSL https://install.5dive.com | bash -s -- --upgrade && systemctl restart '5dive-agent@*.service'
```
Claude-runtime agents keep project memory under `~/.claude/projects/<dir>/memory/` across restarts — session resets, knowledge stays.

## For your AI agent

If you already use Claude Code / Codex / Gemini / opencode, paste this prompt — your agent installs 5dive, learns the skill, then keeps managing agents through chat:

```
Install 5dive on this Linux host so I can use you to manage 5dive agents.

1. Run the installer (idempotent — safe to rerun):
   curl -fsSL https://install.5dive.com | sudo bash
2. Confirm: `5dive --version` prints "5dive 0.1.x".
3. Install the 5dive-cli skill — replace <runtime> with one of
   claude-code, codex, gemini-cli, hermes-agent, openclaw, opencode:
   npx -y skills add https://github.com/5dive-com/skills --skill 5dive-cli --agent <runtime> --yes
4. Tell me to restart so the skill loads, then ask which agent to create first.
```

**Installing onto a remote VM over SSH?** Same prompt, prefix the install line with `ssh -t <user@host>`. Install the skill on the laptop where you're issuing `ssh` from, not the remote. Use `ssh -t` for anything needing a TTY (e.g. `5dive agent auth login`).

### JSON output

Every command accepts `--json`. Output is `{ok:true,data:...}` on success or `{ok:false,error:{code,class,message}}` on failure. Exit code matches `error.code` so shell pipelines branch without parsing. Progress lines stay on stderr; stdout is always valid JSON.

```json
{ "ok": true,  "data": [ {"name": "main", "type": "claude", "active": "active"} ] }
{ "ok": false, "error": { "code": 4, "class": "not_found", "message": "no agent named 'foo'" } }
```

---

## Requirements

- Linux with `systemd` (Ubuntu 22.04+ recommended)
- root for install (installer apt-installs `jq`, `tmux`, and other deps)

No systemd / no root / not Linux? Use the [Docker image](#other-paths).
