# 5dive CLI

Open-source CLI to spawn, manage, and message AI agents — any model, any machine.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5dive-com/5dive-cli/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

No auth proxying. 5dive runs your AI CLI of choice (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Hermes, openclaw, opencode) on your own server — you log in with your own credentials, exactly like you would locally. Your auth tokens never touch us.

No telemetry. The CLI does not phone home, send usage data, or report errors anywhere — it only talks to the model providers you configure.

---

## What it does

`5dive` is a runtime manager for AI agents. Each agent is a persistent process (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Hermes, openclaw, opencode) running in a tmux session under systemd, with optional Telegram or Discord wiring so you can message it from your phone.

```
5dive agent create my-agent --type=claude
5dive agent send my-agent "summarize the logs in /var/log"
5dive agent ask  my-agent "what's the status of the deploy?" --timeout=60
5dive agent list
5dive agent logs my-agent --follow
```

---

## Agents that talk to each other

Every agent can call `5dive agent send` and `5dive agent ask` on any other agent on the same host. Stand up a small team — drafter, reviewer, deployer — each with its own model, auth, isolation tier, and channel, all sharing one command surface.

```sh
# from inside one agent's own session, talking to another:
5dive agent send  reviewer "review this diff before I push"
5dive agent ask   researcher "find the canonical postgres tuning guide" --timeout=300
```

No coordinator service, no orchestration layer, no API. The CLI itself is the bus. Spawn a senior agent and a junior, give them different prompts, let them pass work. Have one agent delegate research while another holds the user-facing thread.

This is the feature most people don't realize they need until they try it.

---

## Quickstart

**1. Install** (or upgrade an existing install with `bash -s -- --upgrade`)
```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5dive-com/5dive-cli/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

Rerunning the installer is safe — it won't touch your registry, auth profiles, or agents. `--upgrade` skips apt/nvm/bun entirely and only refreshes the CLI binaries, systemd unit, and hooks.

**2. Add credentials**
```sh
# Claude (Anthropic)
5dive agent auth set claude --api-key sk-ant-...

# or sign in interactively (device code)
5dive agent auth login claude
```

**3. Create an agent**
```sh
5dive agent create my-agent --type=claude
```

Or wire it to a Telegram bot so you can message it from your phone — [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) gives you the token:
```sh
5dive agent create my-agent --type=claude --channels=telegram --telegram-token=<bot-token>
5dive agent pair my-agent --code=<pairing-code>   # one-time DM handshake
```

**4. Talk to it**
```sh
5dive agent send my-agent "hello"
5dive agent ask  my-agent "what model are you?"
```

**5. Attach to the live session**
```sh
5dive agent my-agent tui
```

## Agent commands

```
5dive agent list
5dive agent create <name> --type=<type> [--channels=none|telegram|discord]
                          [--telegram-token=<token>] [--discord-token=<token>]
                          [--with-skills=<spec>] [--no-skills]
5dive agent clone  <src> <dst>
5dive agent start  <name>
5dive agent stop   <name>
5dive agent restart <name>
5dive agent rm     <name>
5dive agent send   <name> <text...>
5dive agent ask    <name> <text...> [--timeout=120]
5dive agent logs   <name> [--follow] [--lines=N]
5dive agent stats  <name>
5dive agent <name> tui
```

---

## Telegram / Discord channels

Agents can accept messages directly from Telegram or Discord bots:

```sh
5dive agent create my-agent --type=claude --channels=telegram --telegram-token=<bot-token>
5dive agent pair my-agent --code=<pairing-code>
```

---

## Isolation tiers

Control what each agent can access on the host:

| Tier | What it can do |
|------|---------------|
| `admin` | Full host access |
| `standard` | Read shared files, limited write |
| `sandboxed` | Private isolated space only |

```sh
5dive agent create my-agent --type=claude --isolation=sandboxed
```

---

## Skills

Skills are `SKILL.md` prompt bundles that drop into any agent. Install one or more at create time:

```sh
5dive agent create my-agent --type=claude --with-skills=notify-user,5dive-cli
```

---

## Accounts (shared auth profiles)

Group sign-ins so multiple agents share one login:

```sh
5dive account add work
5dive account login work --type=claude
5dive agent create agent-a --type=claude --auth-profile=work
5dive agent create agent-b --type=claude --auth-profile=work
```

---

## Health check

```sh
5dive doctor
5dive doctor --repair   # attempt auto-fixes
5dive doctor --json     # machine-readable output for CI
```

---

## Local web dashboard

```sh
5dive ui                        # opens http://localhost:5175 (loopback only)
5dive ui setup                  # configure password auth
5dive ui --host=0.0.0.0         # expose on the network (requires setup first)
```

See [ui/README.md](ui/README.md) for the full auth model and a reverse-proxy
recipe for exposing the dashboard publicly.

---

## Securing your server

5dive puts agents with shell access on a box you control. That's a powerful default — and a responsibility. Standard server hygiene matters more here than for a static web app, because a compromised agent is a compromised shell.

The shortlist:
- **Keep the OS patched.** Enable `unattended-upgrades` (Ubuntu) or your distro's equivalent.
- **Lock down SSH.** Key-only auth, no root login, no password fallback (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`).
- **Firewall by default-deny.** Open only SSH and — if you're exposing it — the dashboard port. `ufw` is the easy option.
- **Don't expose the dashboard naked.** `5dive ui setup` configures password auth before you bind beyond loopback. Behind a reverse proxy with TLS if you publish it.
- **Restrict who can pair.** Each Telegram-paired agent has an access allowlist (`telegram:access` skill). Use it.
- **Pick the right isolation tier.** `sandboxed` for untrusted work, `standard` for shared-file flows, `admin` only when an agent really needs to manage the host.

For deeper baselines, the standard tools are well-maintained — [devsec.os_hardening](https://github.com/dev-sec/ansible-collection-hardening) (Ansible), [Lynis](https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis) (audit), [fail2ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/) (brute-force protection). 5dive doesn't reinvent any of this — use whichever fits your workflow.

## Managed platform

Or skip the checklist. [5dive.com](https://5dive.com) runs the same CLI on a managed cloud: VM, hardening, dashboard, allowlists, backups, uptime — handled. You point it at the agent. We point it at the box.

---

## Requirements

- Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+ recommended)
- `bash` 5+, `jq`, `tmux`, `systemd`
- Root access for install

---

## Contributing

The installed `5dive` is a single bash file — that's deliberate, so `curl … | sudo bash` can fetch one artifact. The source is split for readability:

```
src/header.sh           # set -euo pipefail, globals, declare -A maps
src/lib/*.sh            # error_codes, output, validation, state/audit/registry,
                        # agent_setup (channel + skill + preseed installers)
src/cmd_*.sh            # one file per top-level subcommand
                        # (auth, account, agent, skill, doctor, watch, compose)
src/main.sh             # usage(), main(), EXIT trap, main "$@"
```

`./build.sh` concatenates them (in an order pinned by the script — not a glob) into the single-file `5dive` bundle that lives at the repo root. The bundle is committed so the installer keeps fetching one file; CI runs `./build.sh && git diff --exit-code 5dive` on every push so the bundle and `src/` can never drift apart. If CI fails on bundle-drift, run `./build.sh` locally and commit the result.

Don't `source` files at runtime — it breaks the one-liner install and bash's cross-file scoping has enough ordering footguns to avoid.
